#88. Have telephone and e-mail made communication between people less personal?

Some people argue that telephones and e-mail have made communication between people less personal. I both agree and disagree with this statement.

Truely, Telephones and email are less personal than meeting someone face-to

face. However, They on any account can't impair the intimacy between people.

As mentioned above, using the telephone or email to communicate with others is definitely less personal than speaking with someone in person. There are many advantages of communicating with someone face to face. For example, you can read their body language. Body language, which includes facial expressions, is a key indicator of how a person is reacting to the conversation. If we are not present to be able to see these clues, there is much more room for misinterpretation. This can cause annoying misunderstandings between people, especially when having a serious discussion about an important matter.

This, however, does not mean that communication is less personal between people because of these technologies. I believe that when people need to have a serious conversation, they will use the telephone or email to set up a meeting time to discuss a topic in person. For the most part, individuals will not have an important conversation utilizing one of these methods. When viewed from this perspective, it becomes clear that the telephone and email actually enhance our ability to communicate effectively with others. Because of these technologies, we can easily access others when necessary.

In conclusion, I think that if a person is going to solely use the telephone or email as his primary method of communication, his communication with others will definitely be less personal. However, if the person uses these technologies to contact others, but saves important conversations for face-to-face meetings, there is no loss of connection.

> ### 译文

> **88. 电话和电子邮件使得人们的交往不那么亲密？**

> 有些人说电话和电子邮件使人们在进行交流的时候不那么亲密了。我对这种看法既同意也不同意。和面对面的交流相比，电话和电子邮件确实缺少亲密的因素。但是，这些交流方式并没有削弱人们之间的亲密。

> 正如上面我已经提到过的，用电话或者电子邮件交流比面对面交流缺少亲密的因素。面对面交流有很多好处，例如，你能看到对方的身体语言。身体语言包括面部表情等，是人对谈话做出反应的一个重要指标。如果我们看不到这些线索，很可能就会产生“解码错误”。而这能引起人们之间令人苦恼的误解，特别是就重要问题需要进行严肃谈话的时候。

> 但是这并不意味着因为有了新技术人们之间的交流就不亲密了。我相信当人们需要认真谈谈的时候，他们将会通过电话或电子邮件商定一个面对面交流的时间。最重要的是，没有人会通过电话或者电子邮件进行重要的谈话。从这方面来看，很清楚地表明的是电话和电子邮件实际上是提高了我们有效交流的能力。因为有了这些技术，在需要的时候我们就可以很容易地找到要找的人。

> 总的说来，我认为如果一个人把电话和电子邮件作为他与他人交流的惟一方式，那么他的交流就不是亲密的。但是，如果一个人只是运用这些技术与他人进行联系，而重要的谈话还是通过面对面地进行的话，就没有什么联系上的损失了。
