#47. A large company or a small one,which do you want to work for?

While some people enjoy the relative comfort, stability, and prestige of working at a large company, I prefer to live life on the edge. Given the choice, I would much prefer to work at small company where I could have more responsibility, more excitement, closer relationships with my coworkers, and a greater sense of accomplishment than I could have at a big company.

If I worked at a large company, my role at the company would be highly specialized and narrowly defined. At a smaller company everyone has to take on extra responsibilities to make the business work. For instance, if I worked at a small computer software company as a programmer, I might not only program, but also have to make trips to potential clients for sales. At a large company, the sales department would talk to clients, and I would be stuck in the same boring routine every day with less responsibility. I might less in touch with what the clients wanted if my responsibilities were limited to programming.

I crave excitement, so the idea of working for a small company particularly suits me. While working at a large company can offer more job security, workers don't usually get any of the annual profits. But if you work for a small company, profits are more likely to be shared at the end of the year. This means that the harder you work, the more potential there is to make a large amount of money. It is also especially gratifying when you can see how your hard work helped to build or save the company, a feeling of accomplishment that is difficult to attain when working in a large company.

Finally, working together in a small company creates a sense of special closeness between colleagues. You have to both trust and depend on each other for everything. This closeness is not only between people within the company but can also extend to your clients and suppliers, all of whom you can get to know on a first name basis. Business deals become less impersonal and more pleasurable when you work with people you trust and like. This trust is both deeper and easier to build when you work for a smaller company.

> ### 译文

> **47. 就职于大公司还是小公司？**

> 虽然有些人喜欢在大公司工作的舒适稳定与声誉，我却更喜爱边缘的生活。要是给我选择，我宁愿到小公司工作，在那里我可以有更多的责任与刺激、更亲密的同事关系和较之在大公司取得的更大的成就感。

> 如果我在大公司里工作，我在公司里的角色将会高度专业化，只有狭小的界定范围。在小公司里，每个人都必须承担起额外的责任使得事务运转。例如，如果我曾在一家小的电脑软件公司里担任程序设计员，我可能不止设计程序，还要为了销售而制定行程去拜访潜在客户。而大公司会有销售部与客户洽谈，我将每天墨守成规，责任变小。如果职责只限于编程，我与需求客户的接触就会减少。

> 我渴望刺激，因此在小公司工作的想法尤其适合我。虽然大公司能提供更多的职位保障，员工却通常得不到任何年度利润。但是如果为小公司工作，年终分红的可能性就大得多了。这意味着你越努力工作，你就越有可能挣一大笔钱。看到你的辛勤工作有助于建设或拯救公司尤其令人满足，这是在大公司工作难以获得的成就感。
