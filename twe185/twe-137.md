#137. Should high schools allow students to study the courses that students want to study?

High school is a very important time in a person's educational career. During this period, they will learn many of the skills necessary to be successful in university and the work world. There are both advantages and disadvantages of students picking their own courses in high school. The disadvantages are that high school students are too young to have good judgment about what they really require and also, it's very important for a young person to get a rounded education. The advantage of adolescents picking their own courses is that people should be able to start exploring their aptitudes at a young age.

If children are able to pick all of their own courses in high school, it is more than likely that they will pick all"easy" courses, such as arts or music courses. Children do not necessarily know what is best for them, and therefore, could end up lacking later in life because of the poor, uninformed decisions they made as adolescents.

Young people need a well-rounded, balanced education. A good education should include everything from languages to mathematics to science, etc. Many children would avoid their most disliked courses if given the opportunity. A well-rounded education leads to well-balanced people, which in turn leads to a tolerant, knowledgeable society. It is important to have a wide basis of knowledge concerning how the world works.

As mentioned above, there is also an advantage of allowing children to pick their own courses in high school. Picking one's own courses means that one will be able to focus on subject areas that are particularly interesting to the individual. Adolescents should be able to hone in on their likes and dislikes at a young age, as this will give them a better understanding of where their aptitude lies.

In conclusion, I think that students in high school should be able to choose some of their own courses. There should definitely be a required curriculum, but it should leave room for students to take selectives that they are truly interested in.

> **137. 中学是否应该让学生自行决定所学课程？**

> 中学是一个人受教育过程中非常重要的一段时间。在此期间，学生将学习在大学和工作中取得成功所必需的许多技能。让学生们自行选择他们在中学阶段的课程既有利也有弊。不利的是，中学生还太年轻，对自己真正需要什么东西还没有很好的判断，而且，让一个年轻人接受到全面的教育也是非常重要的。对十几岁的青少年来说，自行挑选课程的优势就是，人们将在早年开始发掘自己的才能。

> 如果一个孩子能够自行挑选中学的所有课程，那很有可能他会选择所有那些“轻松的”科目，像艺术或音乐课。孩子们并不一定了解什么对自己是最好的，因此，可能会由于他们十几岁时做出的糟糕而莽撞的决定最终导致日后成年时知识的匮乏。

> 年轻人需要获得全面而平衡的教育。一种良好的教育应该包括从语言到数学到科学等所有的一切。许多孩子只要一有机会就会逃避他们非常讨厌的课程。一个全面的教育会造就能力均衡的人，继而创造一个包容而博学的社会。对世界如何运转拥有广泛的基本了解是很重要的。

> 如上所述，允许孩子们在中学自行挑选课程也是有益处的。自行选择课程意味着，一个人将能够把精力集中在自己特别感兴趣的学科领域。这将使得年轻人更好地了解自己的才华所在，因此可以在早年发现自己的喜好。

> 总之，我认为中学生应该能够自己选择一些课程。肯定要有必修课，但也应该留出余地让学生们参加他们真正感兴趣的选修课。
