#156. A foreign country you would like to visit

The world is a vast and varied place. One could travel for a decade without seeing all of the sights the world has to offer. However, if I could travel anywhere in the world for two weeks, it would be Canada. Canada is a very beautiful country and it has a varied culture. Also, I am considering going to university in Canada, so it would be good for me to see what it is like before application.

Canada boasts that it is one of the most beautiful countries in the world. In particular, Vancouver is very beautiful. The city is located right on the ocean, and there are enormous snow-tipped mountains surrounding the entire city. There are a multitude of beautiful parks to walk through, and very nice beaches. Vancouver, however, is not the only beautiful city in Canada. All across the country there are small, picturesque towns located on mountains and valleys. In general, Canada is an incredibly clean country, which also helps its beauty.

Canada also has a widely varied culture. Most people say the cultural apex of the country is in Montreal. This is one of the oldest cities in Canada, first colonized by the French. As such, the French influence is still quite prevalent in this city, and over half of the people living there speak both English and French. The architecture in Montreal is also quite beautiful.

The final reason why I would love to spend a two-week vacation in Canada is because I am considering attending one of the universities there for my bachelor's degree. I think that it would be an excellent idea to go see the school, and perhaps even meet some of the professors that teach the courses I am interested in. It would also be beneficial for me to meet other students. By doing this, I could find out how good the programs at the school are, and if it is worthwhile to move across the world for.

> ### 译文

> **156. 你想去游览的一个国家**

> 世界是辽阔的，而且有着各式各样的地方。一个人即使旅行十年，也看不完世界上的各种名胜。然而，如果可以在世界上任选一个地方旅行两个星期，我会选择加拿大。加拿大是一个有着多元文化的非常美丽的国家。而且，我正在考虑去加拿大上大学，因此在提交申请之前去看一看对我是很有好处的。

> 加拿大以其为世界上最美丽的国家之一而自豪，而温哥华尤其美丽。这座城市就坐落在海边，白雪盖顶的群山环绕着整个城市。这里有很多美丽的公园可以散步，还有很美的海滩。然而，温哥华并不是加拿大惟一的美丽城市。全国范围之内，到处都有坐落在山上或者山谷中独特的小镇。总的来说，加拿大是一个非常干净的国家，这也使它更加美丽。

> 加拿大也有着差异很大的多元文化。绝大多数人都认为该国的文化中心是蒙特利尔。这是加拿大历史最为悠久的城市之一，它最早是法国的殖民地。因此，在这座城市里，法国的影响直到现在仍然相当普遍，而且一大半住在这里的居民都使用英语和法语两种语言。蒙特利尔的建筑也相当优美。

> 想去加拿大度过为期两周假期的最后一个原因，是我在考虑去一所加拿大的大学完成我的学士学位。我认为去学校看一看是个很好的想法，甚至可能见到教我所感兴趣的课程的教授。能够见到其他的学生也会对我很有帮助。这样，我就能够发现学校提供的课程到底有多好，是否值得我去世界的另一端求学。
