#51. What does success come from, taking risks or careful planning?

Magazines and newspapers never tire of telling stories about people who have come to success quickly by taking risks. However, the problem with taking chances is that, while one can win a fortune, one can also lose everything. Careful planning helps reduce that possibility, and it is a basic skill that all established business people have. Therefore, I believe that continued success in life will be the result of careful planning as well as taking risks.

Careful planning is a requisite part of life, especially when one's decisions can impact one's own life and the lives of others in a significant way. For example, the CEO of a company must weigh all of his options cautiously. After all, his decisions will impact not only his life and that of his family but also the lives of his workers and families. Due to a miscalculation on his part the company could incur significant losses. These losses might be so substantial that the company will be forced to cut jobs in order to save money or save the company itself. Therefore, the CEO's carelessness could cost him his job or, even worse, could cost the jobs of other workers in the company who might be less well-off than him. At the same time, taking chances is necessary on the way to success. People who get too caught-up in careful planning often find themselves unable to make decisions. They are looking for more and more information in order to make a well informed assessment, but they are taking too long. For example, the same CEO who plans the moves of his company carefully so as to minimize the possibility of failure faces tough competition in the business world. In order to stay ahead of his rivals he will have to make decisions on the fly to beat out competing companies who are trying to buy the same materials or sell similar products. Thus, depending on the situation, taking a risk could be necessary to save a company or to ensure its prosperity well into the future.

> ### 译文

> **51. 成功来自冒险还是周密计划？**

> 报纸杂志从来都是不厌其烦地告诉人们谁又通过冒险快速成功了。但是，投机这个问题在于，你可以凭运气得到一笔财产，你也可以失去你所拥有的全部。成功的商业人士所具备的认真做计划的本领可以减少这种可能性。因此，我认为生活中的不断成功是周密计划和冒险尝试共同作用的结果。

> 认真做计划是生活中必备的本领，特别是当要做的决定可以影响自己或者他人生活的时候。例如，公司的首席执行官必须仔细权衡每一个方面。毕竟，他的决定不仅将影响到他自己、他的家人，还将影响他的员工以及员工的家人。他的一个不审慎的决定可以给公司带来巨大损失。有时损失太大，公司不得不为节省开支或者自救而裁员。因此，首席执行官的不慎可能使自己失业，也可能使生活不如自己的下属失业。
