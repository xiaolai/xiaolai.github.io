#174. How is your generation different from your parents' generation?

The world is changing and developing at a faster and faster rate all the time. Because of this, the difference between children and their parents is becoming more pronounced with each new generation. In today's society, there are many differences between the age groups.

When our parents were growing up, the world was filled with turmoil. They were born into a time of war, and generally, lived through a very difficult era. Therefore, our parents are very careful to prevent accidents before they happen, and never act spontaneously. Our parents are very careful with how they spend their money, and do not spend much time relaxing. On the other hand, the current generation has grown up in a very safe, peaceful environment. We do not spend our time worrying about the future; instead, our time is spent enjoying the present.

Second, our methods of entertainment are very different from our parents. Television, computers and the Internet are relatively new inventions. Our parents did not have such luxuries when they were growing up. Instead, they spent their free time outside, going on hikes around the city, or on bike rides. Today, most young people spend their free time inside, either watching television or playing computer games. Outdoor activities are usually saved for special occasions, such as trips outside the city.

The final way that today's generation is different from the previous one is seen in how we view change and progress. As mentioned above, our parents do not enjoy living spontaneously. They like to have a set schedule, and follow it every day. Young people, however, like their lives to be full of adventure. They enjoy searching out the unknown. For example, many students spend copious amounts of time learning English so they can go abroad to a foreign university. Many of our parents will not even get on an airplane to travel across China, not to mention traveling to another continent!

In conclusion, I believe that children are vastly different from their parents in today's society. Young people do not have to struggle to live; everything comes easily to them. The older generation, however, had a much more difficult life. Such large differences in lifestyle have created a very wide generation gap.

> ### 译文

> **174. 你们这一代与父辈们有何不同？**

> 世界正以越来越快的速度不断变化发展着。因此，每一年代的孩子和父母之间的差异变得越来越明显。在今日的社会，各个年龄群之间存在着很多差异。

> 我们父母在成长的时候，这个世界充满了动荡。他们生在战争年代，而且大多人都经历了艰苦的时期。因此我们的父母都非常谨慎小心，在事故发生之前杜绝它们，他们从不会贸然行动。我们的父母对怎样花钱的事非常仔细，并且很少把时间花在休闲上面。相比之下，我们这代人却是成长在和平安定的环境之中，不会花时间为未来担忧；相反，还会把时间花在享受现在上面。

> 其次，我们这代人的娱乐方式同我们的父辈有了很大的差异。电视、电脑和网络相对来说都是些新发明。我们父母在成长时没有这些奢侈品，他们会在室外度过闲暇时光：在城市中远足或者骑车。而今天，大多数年轻人都在家里修闲，要么看电视要么玩电脑游戏。户外活动常常留到了特殊的场合，比如离开城市去旅行。

> 今天的这代人与上一代人的最后一个不同是各自对待变化和进步的看法观点不同。就像上面说到的，我们的父母不会随时享受生活，他们喜欢做一个安排，并且每天都跟着安排走。而年轻人却喜欢生活中充满冒险。他们喜欢去追寻未知事物，例如，有很多学生花非常多的时间来学习英语，这样他们能去一所外国的大学念书。而我们父母中有很多甚至连坐飞机在国内旅行都不愿意，更别说去其他大洲了。

> 总之，我认为在今天这个社会孩子们和父母有着相当大的差异。年轻人不需要为生活去努力奋斗，一切都得到得很容易。而老一辈的人却经历过比这艰苦很多的生活。两代人生活方式有着如此大的差异，也就造成了很深的代沟。
