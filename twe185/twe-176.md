#176. If you could create a new holiday, what person or event would it honor and how would you want p

Holidays are an excellent way to allow societies to honor people or events that have helped their country or the world. There are many things that deserve to be recognized in our culture, but there is one group of people that is underappreciated in society today: inventors. If I were to create a new holiday, it would be to pay respect to these important people and their creations.

Inventors are members of the most unappreciated profession in society today. Without inventors, all civilizations would still be living in the stone age, with no running water, no electricity, and more generally, no comforts. Many inventors create simple objects that do not seem that amazing, but upon closer inspection, one realizes that all inventions contribute greatly to convenience. All societies should pay homage to these great people by honoring them with a holiday.

The first way we could honor inventors is by opening exhibitions in galleries and museums dedicated to the inventions of current and past inventors. Many people have no idea where the greatest inventions came from. By displaying the life work of inventors, people will gain a new appreciation for them. This would also be a learning experience for the public, as they could see what current inventors are working on, and get excited about the upcoming progresses in society.

We could also honor inventors by having a school day dedicated to inventions. It is important to encourage school-aged children to use their imagination to come up with inventions of their own. The school system is excellent in China, but it does not promote free thinking. Children need to be given the opportunity to discover new creations on their own. By having a day dedicated to this, young people would become more interested in the manufacturing of new products and ideas.

So, I believe that inventors deserve their own holiday. They have provided society with so much comfort and convenience. By honoring inventors, we will show them how much we appreciate their efforts, as well as encourage our children to come up with new ideas of their own.

> ### 译文

> **176. 如果你能创立一个节日，你会以此来纪念何人或何事？你想要人们如何来过这个节日？**

> 节日是一种用来纪念那些对国家或世界做出贡献者的非常好的方式。在我们的文化中有很多人和事值得我们称道，可是在今天的社会，有一类人却没有得到人们足够的欣赏，他们就是发明家。如果让我来创立一个新的节日，我会用这个节日来向这些重要人物和他们的发明表示敬重。

> 在今天的社会中，发明家是最得不到人们足够赏识的职业之一。如果没有发明家，所有的社会文明都将停留在石器时代，没有自来水、没有电、更没有舒适的生活。许多发明家发明的物品很简单，而且看起来也不是那么了不起，但是只要你更仔细地观察，便会发现所有的发明其实都给我们带来了极大的便利。所以，每个社会都应该用创立节日的方式，来表达对这些了不起的发明家们的敬意。

> 纪念发明家的第一种方式，是通过在美术馆和博物馆举办展览，来展现过去和当今的发明家及他们的成就。很多人对一些伟大的发明是如何诞生这一问题知之甚少。通过展现发明家们的生平成就，人们能从一个新的角度来欣赏他们。而对公众来说，这也将是一次学习的经历，从中他们能了解到当今的发明家们正在致力的研究，并为社会即将迎来的进步而感到欣喜。

> 我们也可以通过举行校园发明日的方式来纪念发明家。鼓励学龄儿童用自己的想象力去寻找属于他们自己的新发明创造，这是很重要的。中国的教育系统很出色，只是缺少对自由思考的提倡。儿童需要得到依靠自己去发现新发明新创造的机会。通过举办这样的发明日，年轻人会对开发新产品和新点子更加感兴趣。

> 因此，我认为应当为发明家们设立节日。他们为社会提供了那么多的舒适和便利。通过纪念发明家，我们将向他们传达我们的欣赏之情，并能借此鼓励我们的孩子去寻找他们自己的新想法。
