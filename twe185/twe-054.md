#54. Should one judge a person by external appearances?

People should look beyond superficial appearances. All too often we judge people quickly, and we do not take the time to get to know them. We draw conclusions based on prior experiences and stereotypes. Of course, there are situations in which judging a person based on appearance is necessary, but such quick conclusions can lead to serious misjudgments, and they often prevent progressive change within society.

As time is limited, we often don't have enough of it to get to know a person well, and thus we are forced to form an opinion hastily. During a job interview, for example, decisions have to be made very quickly. If the applicant for an office job does not dress in accordance with the standards of the employer, he will probably not get hired for the position, although he might be the best qualified candidate overall. Another applicant will take his place, because his qualifications, including his ability to dress and present himself professionally, appear to address the needs of the company better.

In most other cases, however, judging based on external appearance can lead to many misjudgments. An old person is not necessarily wiser than a young person, because wisdom is the result of experience and not age. A person dressed in old jeans and tennis shoes does not have to be poor or without means, she might merely prefer the comfort of her old clothes to the discomfort of high heels and business suits.

Judgments based on appearance will also prevent progressive change within society, because people will come to conclusions based on stereotypes. For example, a person with very dark skin might be from an African country, but he/she might also be from another continent altogether. Likewise, his/her skin color does not reveal anything about his/her likes or dislikes, his/her character traits or personality. Nevertheless, almost every person will invariably jump to conclusions on all of these, thereby precluding any contact or true understanding of the person and his/her background. As a result, common perceptions will persist and no progressive change will take place.

> ### 译文

> **54. 是否可以以貌取人？**

> 我们不应该仅仅以外表来判断一个人。可是我们经常很快对人做出判断，不再花时间来了解。我们根据以前的经验和老套的观点得出结论。当然，有时依靠外表判断人也是必需的，但是很快就做出结论会导致严重的判断错误，阻止社会的前进步伐。

> 由于时间关系，我们通常没有时间来了解一个人，所以我们被迫匆忙地形成自己的看法。例如，面试的时候就需要很快做出决定。如果求职者的穿着打扮不符合雇员身份的标准，即使他可能非常适合这个职位，那他也很有可能求职失败。而成功的求职者往往有着良好的着装技巧，使自己看起来非常职业化、更符合公司的要求。

> 但是，在其他情况下，凭外表判断一个人往往导致判断失误。年长的人不一定比年轻人更有智慧因为智慧是经验而不是年龄的结晶。一个穿着破旧牛仔裤、网球鞋的人并不一定没有钱，她也许只是觉得穿旧衣服很舒服，不喜欢穿高跟鞋和职业套装。

> 依靠外表判断人也会阻止社会前进的步伐，因为人们往往根据老套的观点做出结论。例如，黑皮肤的人可能是个非洲人。可是他或她也很有可能来自其他大洲。 同样，他或她的肤色并不能反映出他或她的喜好、特点、性格等。然而人们往往总是一眼就对以上几点做出结论，不再试着去了解他或她及他或她的背景。结果，普通的观点得以继续，社会不能进步。
