#162. Do famous athletes and entertainers deserve high salaries?

There are many famous entertainers and athletes who gross millions of dollars every year. I tend to believe that they in a sense do deserve such high paying salaries. Being a famous entertainer or athlete requires copious amounts of hard work. This job also forces one to give up all of their privacy. Moreover, working in these fields means that one must be the very best.

To become famous, whether in the sports industry or the movie industry, takes a lot of hard work. One must train for years and years to make it to the level of a professional. Not only is this tiring, it also costs a lot of money. If one hopes to reach the level of a superstar, he/she must spend money on training and bettering himself/herself. This is not an easy lifestyle, and requires dedication, which many people do not have.

Second, these stars deserve to make a lot of money because they must give up their privacy to serve the public. As soon as stars leave their homes, they are subjected to constantly being pestered by people who want their autograph or want to take pictures of them. Famous people must undergo the intense scrutiny of the media; television and newspaper reporters take note of every action these people do, and publicize it. Again, this is a difficult lifestyle to lead, as one must constantly be careful of what one says in public.

Finally, working in these industries means that one was born with natural talent. They have harnessed a skill that very few others can call upon. If there were no people in society who could play such a role, the entertainment industry would quickly fall into oblivion. We need these people's skills to entertain us.

In conclusion, I think that famous athletes and movie stars deserve their pay.

While it seems like too much money when we first hear how much they make, after careful consideration, we realize that they must put a lot of work into their careers, much more than ordinary people do in many cases.

> ### 译文

> **162. 有名的运动员和艺人应该拿高薪吗？**

> 很多著名演艺明星和运动员每年都能有上百万美元的收入。我倾向于认为他们从某种意义上说应该得到这样的高收入。成为一个著名的演艺明星或者运动员必须付出大量的辛勤工作。这种职业也迫使他们放弃了自己的隐私。此外，在这些领域工作意味着他们必须非常出色。

> 无论是在体育界还是文艺界，为了成名都要进行大量的艰苦工作。一个人必须要经过多年的训练才能达到专业水平，而且不仅仅是训练，还要付出大量的金钱。如果一个人想要达到超级明星的水平，他必须付出金钱来训练和完善自己。这并不是一种轻松的生活方式，而且需要奉献精神，这是很多人所不具备的。

> 第二，这些明星应该得到很多金钱，因为他们必须放弃自己的隐私来为大众服务。明星一出家门，就会不断被那些想要得到他们亲笔签名或者给他们拍照的人们纠缠。名人必须忍受媒体极为细致的审查；电视和报纸的记者们会记录下来这些名人的一举一动，并将其公开。我要再次重申，这是一种艰难的生活方式，而且他们必须一直都对自己向公众所说的话非常谨慎。

> 最后，在这些领域工作意味着一个人有着与生俱来的天赋。他们掌握了很少有人能够企及的技巧。如果社会上没有人能够扮演这样的角色，娱乐业很快就会被人们遗忘。我们需要这些人的技巧来娱乐。

> 总之，我认为著名运动员和电影明星应该得到他们的高额报酬。当我们最初听到他们收入的数量时，似乎会觉得太多，但是经过认真思考，我们意识到他们要在职业生涯中付出很多，比普通人在很多情况下要多得多。
