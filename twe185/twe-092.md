#92. Living in places that have the same weather all year long, or in areas where the weather changes

Because China is such a vast country, the weather and climate changes dramatically from one part of the country to another. Some parts have a mild, warm temperature all year long, whereas other regions of the country have weather patterns that shift dramatically from hot to cold over the year.

Given the choice to live in one type of climate or the other, I would choose to live in a region where the weather is constantly changing throughout the year. The reasons for this are varied. First, I enjoy the different seasons. Second, I take pleasure in many different sports, some of which require warm weather, and others require the cold. Finally, I enjoy living in a region with constantly changing weather because I think that change is good for one's health.

As mentioned above, one aspect I love about living in a region with changing climates is the shift in seasons. I really enjoy walking through a city and being able to see the trees turn from bright green in the summer, to brown in the fall, to bare in the winter, and then come back to life again in the spring. I find the process of nature very beautiful, and appreciate living in a city where I can observe these changes.

In addition to enjoying the seasons, I also get pleasure from playing a wide variety of sports. Some of these sports require summer weather, like swimming, but others require winter weather, like skiing or ice-skating. By living in a region with extreme changes in seasons, I am able to enjoy all of my favorite activities.

Finally, I enjoy living in an area with changing temperatures because I believe that the extreme temperatures are good for one's health. By allowing one's body to adjust to the extremes, one builds their immune system and is healthier overall.

Overall, I find that living in a changing environment is more interesting than living in one where the climate is always constant. I find that if I am sick of the cold in the winter, I can always take a short plane ride to somewhere that is warmer.

> ### 译文

> **92. 住在气候终年不变的地方，还是住在气候一年数变的地方？**

> 中国是一个幅员辽阔的国家，因此各地气候差异较大。有的地方终年气候温和，温度适宜，而有的地方的气候则要在一年中经历从炎热到寒冷的巨大变化。

> 如果要在两种气候条件中做出选择，我会选择居住在气候不断变化的地区。原因有很多：第一，我喜欢季节分明；第二，我热衷于从事不同的运动，这些运动有的需要在温暖的气候中进行，有的则只适宜于寒冷的条件；第三，我认为气候变化有利于人的身体健康，所以，我喜欢居住在气候不断变化的地区。

> 如上所述，我喜欢住在有气候变化的城市中的原因之一是因为有季节的更替。我喜欢漫步在一个城市里，能够看到树叶从夏天的深绿，到秋天的褐黄，到冬天的凋零，再到春天的复苏。我觉得，大自然的这种过程非常美，我非常喜欢住在一个能够观察到这些自然变化的城市里。

> 除了喜欢不同的季节，我还从各种运动中得到了很多乐趣。有的运动适合在夏天进行，比如游泳，而有的运动则只能在冬天进行，比如滑雪或滑冰。居住在一个季节分明的地区，我就能够尽情享受所有我所喜欢的运动了。

> 我喜欢住在有气候变化的地方的最后一个原因是，我认为温度的极限变化对健康有利。通过身体调节来适应这种温差变化，人们可以完善自身的免疫系统，变得更加健康。

> 总得来说，我认为住在气候变化的环境里比住在气候总是一成不变的环境里要有趣得多。如果受不了冬天的寒冷，我还可以乘飞机去温暖的地方做短途旅行。
