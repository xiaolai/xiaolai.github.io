#149. How would you use some land given to you?

Living in a bustling city is very convenient at times. However, there is usually one thing lacking from these urban landscapes: trees, flowers, and greenery in general. If I received a portion of land in the city, I would transform it into a park. There are many reasons for doing this, as detailed below.

Firstly, a park would offer a much-needed relaxing place, which is usually few and far between in cities. Many people commute to the city for work, and find that the stress of their jobs, combined with the intensity of urban life, is very tiring. If one could walk through a park on one's lunch break, she/he would go back to work feeling refreshed and rejuvenated. A park can also contain many plant species that are not prevalent in the surrounding environment. The calm, The second reason why I would build a park is for environmental reasons. Trees' main function in the ecological cycle is to convert carbon dioxide into oxygen during a process known as photosynthesis. Almost all major cities have a problem with pollution, and every tree helps. In addition to cleaning the air, parks offer a habitat for many species of animals that would regularly not survive in an urban environment. Offering animals a place to live is a very noble thing to do.

Lastly, I believe that building a park would be making the best use of my property because it would create a community focal point. People from all over my neighborhood could wander through the beautiful landscape, conversing with each other and getting to know one another better. In my park I would also include benches and tables where people could have barbeques and picnics, or play social games such as chess or mahjong. I would also be inclined to include badminton nets, table tennis facilities and a football field for the more athletically inclined.

Thus, I believe that the most appropriate use of a piece of land in an urban environment would be to develop it into a green space. By doing this, one creates a location where community, serenity, and the interests of the environment are all taken care of.

> ### 译文

> **149. 你将如何使用给你的土地？**

> 住在熙熙攘攘的城市里面有时非常方便。然而，城市中的风景通常都会缺乏这些：树木、花朵以及绿色植物。如果我得到了城市中的一块土地，我会把它建成一座公园。我这样做有很多原因，详述如下。

> 首先，公园能够提供一个城市必需的休息场所，这种场所通常非常稀少并远在两座城市之间。很多人每天乘火车来到城市里上班，发现工作压力以及高强度的城市生活让他们非常疲倦。如果能在午餐休息的时候在公园里走一走，在他回去工作的时候就会觉得精神振作、恢复了活力。公园中还可以种植很多周围环境中不常见的植物品种。公园中安静和未受到污染的空气让那里成为这些植物生长的绝佳场所。

> 我想建造公园的第二个原因是为了环境。树木在生态环境中的主要功能是把二氧化碳转化为氧气，这个过程被称为光合作用。几乎所有的大城市都存在污染问题，而每一棵树都能减轻污染。除了净化空气，公园还为很多通常在城市环境中不能生存的动物提供了栖息地。给这些动物提供栖息地是一件非常高尚的事。

> 最后，我相信建造一座公园将会最好地利用这块土地，是因为它将成为一个社区的焦点。我们整个社区的人们都能够在优美的景色中漫步，彼此相识并且更好地相互了解。在我的公园中还会安放供人们进行烧烤和野餐的长椅和桌子，人们也可以用它们玩国际象棋或者麻将。我还想修建诸如羽毛球网、乒乓球台等设施，以及一个更具有运动性的足球场。

> 因此，我相信在城市环境中使用一块土地最适当的方法就是把它建成一块绿色空间。这样，我们就能建造一个兼顾到社会、宁静以及环境利益的场所。
