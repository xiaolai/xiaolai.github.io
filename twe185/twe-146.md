#146. Leisure activities: outdoors or indoors?

When one lives in a seasonal environment it is difficult to deny that both outdoor and indoor activities have their place. As the seasons change, so does one's mood. Certain activities become more or less appealing, depending on the weather and the length of the day.

Spring is a time of the year when the world starts to awaken from its winter slumber. The trees and flowers bloom, birds return from their migrations and there is a general sense of gaiety in the air. During this season, I enjoy going on long walks through parks and watching the world come alive.

Many consider summer to be the apex of the year. The city comes into full swing as the weather becomes warmer and warmer. During the summer, I prefer to spend the daytime anywhere that is air-conditioned. This can include the library, a shopping center or a movie theater. I often enjoy spending the warm evenings sitting on the wide balcony of my house and having drinks with my friends.

Fall, with the turning of the leaves and the intense heat of the summer dissipating, is another excellent time to go on long walks during the day. I love to be outside during fall and see the life of the city returning to its hibernation. Another reason to go outside during autumn is to savor the last days of warmth until the next year.

Winter brings the shortening of days and cooler weather. Outdoor activities tend to become less attractive and curling up on the couch with a good book becomes my favorite activity. It is not enjoyable to spend time outside if it is too cold. The only exception to this is the rare time I go skiing.

So, my decision to spend time indoors or outdoors is vastly dependent on the season. Different seasons call for different activities and therefore it is impossible to choose whether I would spend all of my leisure time indoors or outdoors.

> ### 译文

> **146. 喜欢户外还是室内的休闲活动？**

> 当一个人居住在季节分明的环境中时，很难否认户外和室内运动都是可行的。随着季节的变换，人的心情也会改变。根据天气和白天的长度，特定的活动会变得有更多或者更少的吸引力。

> 春天是一年里整个世界都开始从冬眠中苏醒过来的时候。树木发芽，鲜花盛开，候鸟从南方归来，空气中弥漫着欢乐的气氛。在这个季节里，我喜欢在公园里长时间散步，欣赏这万物复苏的世界。

> 很多人认为夏天是一年中的顶点。随着天气越来越热，整个城市逐渐进入了兴旺时期。在夏季，白天我喜欢呆在任何有空调的地方，包括图书馆、购物中心和电影院。在温暖的夜晚，我经常和朋友们坐在家里宽阔的阳台上喝酒。

> 秋季，随着树叶颜色的改变和夏季酷热的逐渐消散，成为了另一个在白天长时间散步的最佳时间。秋季我喜欢呆在户外，看着城市的生命力渐渐进入冬眠。另一个在秋季到室外的原因，是尽情享受来年之前最后的温暖时光。

> 冬季的白天更短，天气更冷。户外活动变得不再那么有吸引力，拿着一本好书蜷缩在睡椅上成了我最喜欢的活动。如果天气太冷，呆在户外就不是那么令人愉快了。惟一的例外是我偶尔出去滑雪。

> 所以，我呆在室内或者室外相当程度上是随着季节而定的。不同的季节需要不同的活动，因此让我选择在室内或是室外度过全部空闲时间是不可能的。
