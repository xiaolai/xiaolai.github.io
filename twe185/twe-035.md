###35. Live performance or television broadcast,which is more enjoyable?

While watching live performances on television is convenient, it cannot compare to attending a live performance in person. Live performances, whether artistic, sporting, or entertainment, offer unique sensations apart from the performance itself, and encourage a greater level of participation as well as a better understanding of the event than a television broadcast could.

The wonderful sensory experience of a soccer match begins before the game starts. The smell of popcorn and street food wafting through the air, the crowd roaring and waving like an ocean, and the excited songs of the fans are all part of the experience that adds to the enjoyment of watching the game in person. A rock concert is not just hearing the music; it is the feeling of standing in a crowd that is moving together like one living body to the beat of the drums. These experiences are all important parts of the experience of an event, and cannot be felt when watching the same event on television.

When watching a performance in person, a viewer feels a closer sense of connection to the event. Every fan in the stadium will always leap to their feet when they see their favorite team score a goal in a soccer match, while only a few people might jump up watching the same goal at home. Watching a music performance on television wouldn't necessarily make people want to start dancing, but hearing a jazz band play live would start every foot in the room tapping, just itching to dance. Live events seem to invite the active participation of the viewing audience, while television is a medium that encourages passivity on the part of the viewer.

The understanding of a performance viewed on television is usually limited. A rock performance viewed live has ear-shatteringly loud music. While some people might not enjoy this, it is a part of the experience that television filters out. At any given time during a sporting event there are many different things going on at once. Because television cameras can only focus on one event at a time, a live viewer can take in a larger field of vision, and potentially understand more about the events. Finally, live viewers' understanding of live performances is increased because live performances are not interrupted with commercial breaks every 12 minutes.

> **35. 现场表演和电视转播哪个更精彩？**

> 尽管在电视上看现场表演十分方便，但这与亲临现场观看演出还是无法相比。无论是艺术表演、体育比赛还是娱乐演出，现场表演相对电视转播，除了展现表演本身独一无二的气氛外，还能激发观众更深入的参与并使其加深对该表演的了解。

> 一场足球比赛精彩的感官经历在比赛之前就已经开始了。空气中飘荡着爆米花和街头食品的味道，人群呼喊着、起伏着，像海洋一样，还有球迷们兴奋的歌声都是只有亲临现场观看比赛才能体会到的欢乐。摇滚音乐会并不仅仅是听音乐，它是一种在人群中随着鼓点大家整齐划一一起移动的感觉。这些经历全是现场表演中的重要组成部分，是看电视转播所无法感受到的。

> 当现场看一场表演时，观看者感觉到演出与他们更接近。足球比赛中，体育场里的每一个球迷在看到他们心爱的球队得分时都会从椅子上跳起来，可是在家里看到同一个进球的人却很少会跳起来。看电视里的音乐表演未必会让观众想跳舞，但是现场听爵士乐队的演奏却会使在场的每个人都脚打节拍、心痒得想跳舞。现场演出似乎在邀请现场观众主动参与，而电视则是一种鼓励观众被动享受的媒体。

> 看电视时对演出的理解通常都是有限的。现场的摇滚演出有震耳欲聋的音乐。可能有的人会享受不到这些，这是电视过滤掉的东西。在体育比赛中的任何时间都可能有很多事情同时发生。因为电视摄像机一次只能聚焦于一个事件，而现场观看者可以有更宽的视野，从而可能更多地理解比赛。最后，现场观众能更多地理解比赛是因为不会每12分钟就被商业广告打断。
