#116. What method of learning is best for you?

There are many different methods that people use for learning. Some people learn with hands-on experience, others learn by reading, and still others learn by listening to discussion of other people. It is generally believed that learning is a subjective process, and it is important to discover the ways in which one learns best. I find that personally, learning by doing things is the best way. First, I find that the hands-on method is right for me because I am a very visual learner. If I can see what is happening, I have a much easier time understanding it. Reading a book does not give me this ease. When I read a book in order to gain knowledge, particularly technical one, I sometimes have trouble visualizing exactly what is being explained. However, when I actually see the process happening, it is much easier for me to understand.

I also use a visual method when I am studying English. For example, if I am working on new vocabulary, I will write the words down, and then draw pictures of the words to remind myself of the meaning. Going through the process of drawing the pictures greatly increases my ability to memorize any type of information. When a picture is too simple to be enough or is hard to draw, I will close my eye and draw a mental picture that serves more helpful.

It seems as though most businesses prefer people to have this hands-on experience as well. It is rare to find a good job that does not require applicants to have spent a certain amount of time doing a similar type of work in the past. By having this past experience, it shows that they have learnt to do a particular task well, and that they have practical knowledge of the job.

In conclusion, I think that hands-on learning is best for me, and beneficial for my future. As stated above, however, everyone learns in a different style, and it is important to find the most efficient method for themselves.

> ### 译文

> **116. 何种学习方式最适合你？**

> 人们学习有许多不同的方式。有些人通过亲身经历来学习，有些人通过阅读来学习，还有人通过倾听别人的讨论来学习。大多数人普遍认为，学习是一个主观的过程，因此重要的是发掘最有助于一个人学习的方式。我个人认为，通过做事情来学习是最好的方法。

> 首先，我发现亲身实践的方式适合我，因为我是一个非常形象化的学习者。如果我能看到事情发生的经过，要理解它会容易得多。阅读书籍就给不了我这种轻松的感觉。当我读书学习，尤其是读专业性书籍的时候，我有时会觉得很难确切地想像出所讲解的是什么。然而，当我真正看到发生的过程，理解对我来说就容易许多。

> 我学习英语的时候也使用形象化的方式。例如，如果我在学习新单词，我会把单词写下来，然后描绘出关于单词的图画来让自己记住单词的意思。经过画图这一过程极大地增强了我记忆任何种类信息的能力。当图画太简单不足以表达含义，或者是太难描绘的时候，我就会闭上眼睛，在脑子里想像一幅图，这样可以更好地帮助自己。

> 似乎大多数公司希望人们拥有这种实践的经历。不需要应聘者有相似工作经验的好工作已经很难找了。拥有这种过去的经历，可以表明他们已经学会很好地完成某种工作，而且他们对该工作有实际操作的知识。

> 总之，我认为通过亲身实践的学习最适合我，并且对我的将来会非常有益。然而，如上所述，每个人学习都有不同的风格，重要的是为自己找到最有效的方式。
