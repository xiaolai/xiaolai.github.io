#105. Living in university housing or in an apartment in the community?

Being a new student at a university is an excitment. Choosing where to live, whether on campus in a dormitory, or off campus in an apartment, is in fact quite a big decision. Both of these options have their relative benefits.

Living in a dormitory has many advantages over living off campus. For example, one has the opportunity to meet dozens of new students. One is usually placed in a room with a roommate, who can help with homework, and give much needed support during difficult times. Another advantage of living in a dormitory is not having to cook food. Most students coming to a university have lived their whole lives with their parents, and inexpert at preparing food, for they were not in charge of the cooking in home. Many students who first learn to cook their own food while going to school eat a very unhealthy diet. On top of this, many students are so preoccupied with their studies that they do not have time to cook a nutritious meal. Therefore, the fact that the dormitories include a cafeteria is very beneficial.

However, living off campus has its advantages as well. In most situations, one has much more freedom to do what they want in these living conditions. For instance, one can stay up late studying or come home late without disturbing a roommate. Also, one is not limited to the cafeteria food if he/she is a particular eater. Living by oneself also has its benefits. One never has to deal with rude or messy roommates. Overall, I think that both of these options are good choices. However, I recommend that first or second year students live in a dormitory, and perhaps wait until they are older and more accustomed to university life before venturing out on their own. This way, one gets the best of both worlds: the camaraderie of living with many people and the independence of living by oneself.

> ### 译文

> **105. 住在大学宿舍还是社区公寓？**

> 成为一名大学新生是令人兴奋的。究竟是选择住在学校的宿舍里，还是住在校外的公寓中，事实上是一个很大的决定。两种选择都有其相对的好处。

> 住在校内宿舍里比住在校外有一些优势。比如，一个人可以有机会见到好多新同学。宿舍里通常会有一个室友，他可以在学习上帮助你，还可以在你遇到困难的时候给你支持。另一个好处就是可以不用自己做饭。许多大学生以前都是跟父母生活在一起，不怎么会做饭，因为他们在家里不负责做饭。他们开始学会自己做饭，是因为进入学校后，发现在学校里吃得并不好。另外，许多学生功课特别多，他们根本没有时间自己做可口的饭菜。因此，有自助餐厅的学校宿舍对学生来说会是非常方便的。

> 但是，住在校外也有好处。大多数情况下，住在校外可以有更多的自由空间做自己想做的事情。例如，一个人可以学习到深夜，或者很晚才回家，而不用担心打扰了室友。而且，如果他或她是个吃饭挑剔的人，可以不受学校自助餐厅的限制。自己一个人住的好处还有：不用担心碰到粗鲁或邋遢的室友。
