#106. What kind of transportation you would choose?

If I need to travel to a place 40 miles away from my home, there are a number of different modes of transport I could utilize, namely, I could take the bus, a car, or the train.

The bus is a good choice as the bus system in Beijing has been welldeveloped. It is possible for me to travel almost anywhere within 40 miles of my house by bus. While on the bus, I can read a book, or relax, assuming it is not too full. The problem with taking the bus, however, is that it is often crowded. It is often uncomfortable, especially during hot summer days.

Taking a car is an excellent option, assuming one can afford a car. Cars are notoriously expensive in China, and most people do not have this luxury. However, if it is available, a car is very convenient. You can travel to the exact desired location in record time. A car, especially a personal car, is never crowded. You never have to share space with anyone. However, one cannot relax while driving a car. There is no opportunity to just take in the sights, or read a book. One must always be focused on the road.

The train, or the subway, is another option. If the location I am traveling to is on the subway line, then this option is by far the best. While trains can be congested, they are the fastest method of traveling. Subway trains are never subject to traffic jams, as they usually run underground. However, the subway system in Beijing does not go everywhere that I need to. Often, if I take the subway, I then have to either walk for 20 minutes, or take a bus.

Overall, I think that the car is the best option, if it is available. The car is convenient and comfortable. However, the bus and the train are both good options if a car is not available.

> ### 译文

> **106. 你会选择何种交通方式？**

> 如果需要去一个离家40英里的地方，我可以选择多种交通工具，比如我可以乘公共汽车，坐私人汽车或搭乘火车。

> 北京的公共交通很发达，对我来说，公共汽车是个不错的选择，我可以乘坐公共汽车去离家40英里的任何地方。在汽车上，我还可以看看书或休息一下，当然这是以车上的人不多为前提的。然而，公共汽车的问题在于车上乘客总是很拥挤，这非常不舒服，尤其是在夏天很热的时候。

> 如果自己拥有一辆汽车的话，那乘汽车也是个不错的选择。在中国，汽车非常昂贵，很少人拥有这样的奢侈品。但是，如果拥有一辆汽车，是非常方便的。你可以用最快的时间去任何你想要去的地方。乘坐汽车，特别是私家汽车，从来不会感到拥挤。你永远不必担心跟其他人争夺空间。然而，一个人在开车的时候不可能放松、休息，不可能欣赏景色或看书，只能把精力集中在道路上。

> 火车或是地铁是另外一个选择。如果我要去的地方在地铁沿线，那么乘坐地铁就是目前为止最好的选择。尽管火车很可能会拥挤，但它是最快速的出行方式。地铁永远不会遇到交通堵塞，因为它总是在地下。然而，在北京，地铁系统不会载我们到任何想去的地方。我经常坐完地铁后还不得不步行20分钟或坐公交车。
