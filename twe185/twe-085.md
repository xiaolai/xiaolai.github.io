#85. Where would you recommend a foreign visitor to go in your country for one day?

China is an enormous country with an intensely varied landscape. If a foreign visitor were coming just for one day to see our country, it would be difficult to choose just one place to spend the day. However, I posit that the best place in China to visit would be Beijing. As the capital city, Beijing offers a diverse look at China. I would suggest that the main sites to see would be the Forbidden City, the Great Wall, and Tiananmen Square.

The Forbidden City offers the visitor a look at what it was like to live in historical China. The Forbidden City is located in the heart of Beijing, and is the biggest palace complex in the world. This particular site would be of interest to a tourist because it was once the home of many emperors. One can see the actual rooms from whence the ancient China was ruled by the emperors. When the visitor walks through the palace confines, he/she will see many examples of classic Chinese architecture. A walk through the gardens is particularly peaceful with jasmine trees abound.

The Great Wall is also a must-see in China. The people of China hold the Great Wall as having particular significance to their culture because of its long history. The wall, built of dirt, stone and brick, was used as a defense barrier against invading nomads and wandering tribes. This is the largest engineering andbuilding project ever carried out by humans. Its historic and strategic importance is matched only by its architectural significance.

Finally, Tiananmen Square should be on the list of things to see while visiting Beijing. This square is one of the largest in China, and possibly in Asia. At this square, one can visit the Chairman Mao Memorial Hall, one of the greatest leaders ever in China. The Chinese Revolutionary Museum and the Chinese History Museum stand to the east of the square, the Great Hall of the People to the west and the magnificent Tiananmen Tower to the north. As the visitor will see, there are numerous interesting exhibits at Tiananmen Square that offer up a variety of Chinese heritage.

Of course, it is very difficult to name one city in China over all others as"the place" to visit. China is the host to such a wide variety of beautiful places, and a visitor really should spend much more time exploring them all. However, with only one day, I believe that Beijing is the best place to visit.

> **85. 你会推荐一个外国游客去你国家的什么地方游览一天？**

> 中国是一个具有千变万化的地形地貌的大国。如果一个外国游客仅有一天的时间来游览我们的国家，那么仅能选择一个地方来游览将是件困难的事情。但是，我认为中国最值得游览的地方是北京。北京是中国的首都，拥有着万种风情。我建议参观的主要景点是紫禁城、长城和天安门广场。

> 紫禁城可以让游客感受到在古代中国帝王居住地的情形。紫禁城位于北京的中心地带，它是世界上最大的宫殿群。由于它过去是许多帝王的家，所以对游客来说，这个地方尤其吸引人。人们可以参观那些真实的房间，皇帝们在那里统治着古代中国。当游客沿着宫殿边的线路参观时，将会看到许多经典古代中国建筑的典范。步行穿过茉莉花环绕的花园也是一件很惬意的事情。

> 来中国游玩，长城也是必去的地方。由于长城历史悠久，中国人认为其对于他们的文化具有特别的意义。由泥土、石头和砖建造的城墙曾被用于抵御外来游牧民族的入侵。长城是迄今为止人类所建造的最大的工程和建筑项目，它的历史和战略意义也同样巨大。

> 最后，天安门广场也是你游览北京必去的地方。它是中国乃至全亚洲最大的广场之一。在广场上，你可以参观毛泽东纪念堂，毛泽东是中国历史上最伟大的领袖之一。中国革命历史博物馆矗立于广场的东侧，人民大会堂坐落于西测，而宏伟的天安门城楼则位于广场的北侧。正如游客们所见，天安门广场上有许多有趣的展览，展示着多种多样的中国传统文化遗产。

> 当然，在中国，很难说一个城市比其他的城市更值得游览。中国地大物博，拥有许多美丽的地方，游客真是应该花更多一些的时间将它们全都游览遍。然而，既然只有一天时间，我相信北京是你最好的选择。
