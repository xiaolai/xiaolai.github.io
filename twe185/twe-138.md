#138. Is it better to be a member of a group than to be the leader of a group?

When working in a group, there are many different positions, but basically, one can think of a group as having two job types: member and leader. Some people believe that it is better to be a member of a group than it is to be the leader. However, I think it is better to be a leader in a group because as the leader, one's ideas are more likely to be heard, he/she is more likely to receive accolades for complete work, and he/she is able to make important decisions for the group.

The leader of a group has the strongest voice of all. If someone enjoys coming up with new, exciting concepts and making a difference in a project, then he/she should be the leader. It can be a frustrating experience at time to be a member of a group. At times, a member's ideas are not taken seriously, because he/she does not have respect that the leader has. If one leads a group, his/her ideas will always be heard and respected, and usually followed through with.

When a project is complete, it is the leader that receives accolades for doing a good job. While the entire team gets some respect and appreciation upon completion, it is the leader who receives the most admiration. This is an advantage for building one's resume, and generally gaining respect in society. People always respect the leader of a group more than the members.

Moreover, it is better to be the leader of a group than a member because the leader is able to wield the power. Being the leader means getting a say in all decisions, and often, is allowed to follow through with any ideas that he/ she thinks up. This can mean that things that a person finds important will be completed quickly and efficiently.

Overall, I believe that it is better to be the leader of a group than to be a member. A leader can make decisions, follow through with them, and receive recognition for a job well done. However, there are of course some negatives of being a leader. The leader has much more responsibility for the project than anyone else, and if there is a failure, it is the leader's fault. If a person is willing to take on this added responsibility, then being a leader is by far the best position.

> ### 译文

> **138. 当团队的成员是否比当团队的领导好？**

> 在一个团队工作可以有许多不同的位置，但是大致说来，人们可以认为一个团队有两种职位：成员和领导。有些人认为，做团队的普通一员比当领导要更好。但是，我认为，做团队的领导要好些，因为当一个人做领导时，他的想法更可能被倾听，他更可能由于完成工作而受到称赞，他还能够为团队做出重要的决定。

> 一个团队的领导在所有人中是最有发言权的。如果某个人喜欢提出新的令人振奋的想法，并且对一个项目产生影响，他就应该当领导。团队普通成员有时的经历可能让人沮丧。有时，成员的意见不被认真考虑，因为他们不像领导那样受到敬重。如果一个人领导一个团队，他或她的意见总是会被倾听、被尊重，而且通常会得以执行。

> 当一个项目完成之后，因为工作优异获得称道的便是领导。虽然一项工作完成之后整个团队会获得尊敬和感激，但是领导赢得最多的钦佩。这对抬高一个人的资历是非常有利的，通常还会有助于在社会上赢得威信。相比团队的普通成员，人们总是更多地尊重他们的领导。

> 另外，在一个团队中当领导比做成员要好，因为领导可以拥有权力。做领导意味着在所有的决定中获得了发言权，而且只要是他或她想到的任何意见经常可以得以执行。这就代表着，一个人认为重要的事情将可以迅速而有效地得以完成。

> 总的说来，我认为做团队的领导比当成员要更好。一个领导能够做决定，将它们付诸执行，还可以由于工作出色获得认可。但是，做领导当然也有不利之处。领导对项目负有的责任比其他任何人都要多得多，而且，如果失败，那就是领导的过错。如果一个人愿意承担这种额外的责任，那当领导显然是最好的位置。
