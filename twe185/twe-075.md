#75. Should students be required to take classes in many subjects or to specialize in one subject?

Universities that require their students to take classes in many subjects offer a very different educational experience from the universities that encourage specialization. As higher education becomes a more accessible commodity students will be able to choose between these two different forms of instruction. The answer to the question of which system is better depends on the student's interests and the goals of their studies.

Students who complete a degree at a university which requires them to take classes in many different subjects will receive a well rounded education. Here they will be able to develop their knowledge in different areas, and they will also have the opportunity to find out what their interests really are as they will be exposed to a variety of fields of study. Therefore, this kind of university is ideal for students who have many interests or don't know what their interests are. Also, students who have an interest in education and consider the possibility of graduate school will be able to gain a broader knowledge base before specializing later on in their academic careers. They will be able to pursue education for education's sake and not just to learn a trade. When they try to find work after graduation their versatility will allow them to apply for a wide range of jobs. On the other hand, students who specialize will have a great advantage over students who don't when it comes to finding a job in their specific field of study.

Naturally, companies will be most interested in job applicants who have superior knowledge and can thus make the greatest contributions. At the same time, the specialization system allows students to focus on their interests and the subjects relevant to them. Students majoring in physics or chemistry would feel very out of place in a course on ancient poetry or Western literature. They might consider it a waste of their time and energy. This might then have a negative effect on their educational progress in general.

> **75. 学生应该学习多门课程还是应该术业有专攻？**

> 要求学生学很多门课程的大学和鼓励学生选择专攻专业的大学会给学生带来不同的教育经历。随着大学越来越普及，学生可以在这两种教育模式中进行选择。究竟是哪种体制更好将取决于学生的兴趣和他们学习的目的。

> 在要求学生上很多门课程的大学里，到毕业的时候学生能得到全面的教育。他们在学校可以学习不同领域的知识，因为他们能接触更多的课程，以此来找出自己的兴趣点在哪里。因此，对于那些有着很多兴趣或者不知道自己对什么感兴趣的学生来说，这类学校是最适合他们的。同样，对知识感兴趣并且打算报考研究生的学生，可以在大学里学到更加广阔的知识，而打下良好的基础，然后在继续深造学业的时候确定自己的专攻方向。他们可以因为喜爱知识而学习知识，而不仅仅是为了学习一门专业知识。当他们毕业后找工作时，他们的多才多艺使他们能有更多的选择。

> 另一方面，在找工作的时候，有专业的学生比没有专业的学生更有优势。这很自然，因为公司会对那些具有专业知识，而能用其专业知识为公司做出最大贡献的求职者更感兴趣。同时，分专业的体制可以使学生更加专心于自己的兴趣和与自己兴趣相关的课程。专修物理或化学的学生可能对古诗词和西方文学不感兴趣，他们可能认为学习古诗词和西方文学是在浪费自己的时间和精力，但与此同时，这也可能对他们的整体教育产生消极影响。
