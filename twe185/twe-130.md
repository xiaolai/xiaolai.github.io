#130. The advantages and disadvantages of young children spending much time practicing sports

It is a common activity not only in China, but across the world, for young children to spend copious amounts of time playing and practicing sports. There is much discussion as to whether this is a beneficial way for young people to spend their time. In order to decide, we must consider the advantages and disadvantages.

There are many advantages to children spending their time playing sports. First, children will be stronger and healthier because they are getting exercise. This not only has the immediate effects of being healthy children, but also affects their health later in life, as they will develop good habits for taking care of their physical shape and their health. Second, exercise is known to be an excellent appetite and weight controller. In recent years, with the further development of China, many young people are becoming overweight. Playing sports in one's childhood could definitely help this situation. Finally, sports are excellent social activities. If one plays sports early in life, he will learn about teamwork, perseverance, and goal setting. All of these lessons will help one to become a happier, better adjusted adult.

There are also a few disadvantages to children spending time playing sports.

For example, playing sports detracts from study time, which is very important. If children are playing sports so often that they cannot concentrate on their studies, they should definitely stop. Another disadvantage is that sports can sometimes be dangerous, causing life-long injuries to a person that is not careful. Finally, some people believe that sports are overly competitive, and push children too hard at a young age. It is possible that children would lose self-confidence and self

esteem if they constantly lost at sports. Sometimes, it is the parents that push the children too hard at sports, causing an unwillingness to participate due to a lack of enjoyment.

Overall, I think that sports are beneficial to a young person's life. They offer valuable skills that will be useful throughout one's entire life. As long as one is careful and does not overdo it, sports are an excellent idea for all young children.

> **130. 儿童把大量时间用于体育运动的利与弊**

> 孩子们把大量的时间用于进行体育运动和训练，这不仅在中国，而且在全世界都是一个普遍的现象。关于年轻人这样度过自己的时间是否对他们有益，存在着许多讨论。为了做出判断，我们必须考虑一下有利之处和不利之处。

> 孩子们把时间用于体育运动对他们来说有很多好处。首先，孩子们由于参加锻炼，将会更加强壮和健康。这不仅能让儿童保持目前的健康，而且还会影响孩子们日后的健康，因为他们将通过锻炼培养出注意自己身形和健康的良好习惯。其次，锻炼身体被公认为能保持食欲和控制体重。近年来，随着中国的进一步发展，许多年轻人开始变得肥胖。如果在童年时期就参加体育运动，肯定能帮助缓解这种状况。最后，体育运动是非常好的社交活动。如果一个人早年就参加体育运动，他会学到集体协作、毅力和目标定位。所有这些心得将帮一个人成长为更加愉快、适应性更强的成年人。

> 孩子们把时间花在体育锻炼上也有一些不利之处。比如，体育运动占去了学习时间，而后者是非常重要的。如果孩子参加体育运动的频率过高，他们就无法集中精力在学习上，这时他们肯定必须停止体育活动。另外一个劣势是，体育运动有时候可能会有危险，对一个不太小心的人可能会造成终生的伤害。最后，有些人认为体育运动竞争性太强，在孩子们年纪很小的时候把他们逼迫得太厉害。如果孩子不断地在体育运动上落败，他们有可能会失去自信和自尊。而有时候，是父母过分地逼迫孩子去进行体育运动，结果导致孩子由于缺乏乐趣而不愿意参与。
