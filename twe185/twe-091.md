#91. If you could ask a famous person one question, what would you ask?

In today's society, there is a great amount of pressure on famous people. They must constantly be aware of their appearance, and how they will look in the public's eyes. If I had to pick one question to ask a famous person, I would ask them if they are glad that they achieved fame. I think this question is very interesting because it gives insight into what it would be like to be famous, it tells us about the individual's personality, and it would give the famous people a chance to explain what their life would have been like if they had never been famous.

By asking the above-mentioned question, the famous person would reflect on whether or not they enjoyed their fame. If the person answered that he/she would rather not be famous, it implies that the life of a famous person is not as wonderful as many people expect it would be. However, if the answer was positive, it shows that despite all the negative aspects that come with fame, it is still worth the trouble.

When answering this question, the famous person would give us insight into his/her personality. Perhaps the person would rather be more introverted, and therefore, does not appreciate all of the constant attention. On the other hand, it is possible that the person thrives in admiration and attention, and would not have it any other way. Is the famous person the type of people who does not like having to worry about everything he/she says? Do these types of issues bother him/her? I would find all of this information very interesting. Finally, when answering this question, the person would have to reflect on what his/her life would have been like if he/she had never been famous. Perhaps there were dreams or aspirations that he/she never got to realize because he/ she is now constantly in the public eye. Would life as a regular person have been more enjoyable? By asking the above-mentioned question, all of these queries would be answered.

> ### 译文

> **91. 如果你有机会问某个名人一个问题，你会问什么？**

> 当今社会，名人往往背负着巨大的压力，他们必须时时注重仪表，注意公众形象。如果有机会向名人问一个问题，我会问他们是否为出名而高兴？我认为这个问题很有趣，因为这会让大家明白出名意味着什么，会体现出一个人的个性，会给这位名人一个机会来解释一下如果没有出名，他的生活会是什么样子。

> 通过问这个问题，名人们会反思一下，他们究竟是否喜欢出名。如果有人回答说他或她宁愿没有什么名气，这意味着名人的生活并不像大多数人所预料的那样精彩。然而，如果有人对这个问题做出了肯定的答复，这就表明尽管会招致种种负面效应，出名仍然是值得的。

> 在回答这个问题的时候，我们可以窥探到名人的性格特点。或许这个人性格比较内向，因而不喜欢时时受公众关注；也有可能这个人渴望受到赞美和关注，离开这些便无法生存。名人不得不为自己说的每一句话而担心，被我提问的这位名人是那种不喜欢这种生活的人吗？他或她会经常为此类问题而烦恼吗？我觉得这些信息都非常有趣。

> 最后，在回答问题的时候，这个名人将不得不思考一下如果没有出名，他或她的生活会怎样。也许有很多梦想或愿望会因为他或她总是众人瞩目的焦点而永远也无法实现；如果是一个普通人，生活得会更愉快吗？只要回答了我所提出的那个问题，所有这些质疑就都会得到解决了。
