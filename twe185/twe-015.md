#15. What makes a good neighbor?

Neighbors are extraordinarily important people in our lives. Many people make a decision about what place they want to live in based on their future neighbors. People most want to live near neighbors who are respectful, vigilant, and community-minded.

The foundation of any relationship, whether among neighbors or friends, colleagues or family members, is mutual respect. Respect between neighbors means that when they see each other they will be warm and polite. Neighbors don't have to be friends, but they need not be strangers either. Because neighbors live close together, sometimes it is unavoidable that they will learn personal details about their neighbors. A respectful person will not intrude upon their neighbor's privacy, or share these private details with anyone else.

Another important aspect of being a good neighbor is to be vigilant. If people see a robber trying to break into their neighbor's house, then they should call the police. If they see a neighbor's young child in a dangerous situation, they should help the child, or at least give the alarm. If the government posts new regulations, they will help inform their neighbors of the new laws. If everyone in a neighborhood watches out for each other's safety, then the neighborhood will be a safer and more pleasant place.

Moreover, good neighbors are community-minded. They care about their local environment. Good neighbors will not throw trash on the ground, and if they see trash on the ground they will pick it up. They will make decisions based with consideration to their neighbors. They won't play loud music late at night or get drunk and fight in public. They want to live in a happy, peaceful community and they believe that their personal actions have a direct effect on the happiness of all of their neighbors. If all the people in the community think about the good of the community when they make decisions, the whole community will benefit.

> **15. 好邻居需具备哪些品质？**

> 邻居在我们的生活中格外重要。许多人会根据未来邻居如何来决定居住何地。人们大多愿意住在懂礼貌、警惕性高并有社区意识的邻居周围。

> 任何关系的基础，无论是邻居还是朋友，同事还是家人，都是互相尊重。邻里间的尊重意味着他们见面时会热情礼貌。邻居不一定要成为朋友，但是也不必是陌生人。因为在同一个地方比邻而住，有时难免会对邻居的个人情况有所了解。一个有礼貌的人是不会干涉邻居的隐私的，也不会将这些个人情况向他人讲述。

> 要成为好邻居，另外一个重要的方面就是有警惕心。如果看到盗贼试图闯入邻居家，人们应当去报警。 如果看到邻居的小孩处于危险情况之中，人们应当给与帮助，至少也要警告一下。 如果政府发布了新规定，人们应该将这新法规告诉邻居。如果社区里的每一个人都互相注意安全，那么这里会成为一个更安全、更宜人的地方。

> 而且，好邻居具备社区意识。他们关心当地环境。好邻居不会随地扔垃圾，看到地上有废物也会捡起来。他们做决定时会将邻居考虑在内。他们不会深夜大声放音乐，或者在公共场合酗酒斗殴。他们想在一个快乐平静的社区里居住，相信个人行为会对所有邻居的幸福产生直接影响。如果社区的所有人做决定时都为社区的好处着想，整个社区将受益匪浅。
