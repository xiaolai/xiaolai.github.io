#90. What famous entertainer or athlete would you like to meet?

Famous entertainers and athletes have a vast amount of influence over there. It is up to the entertainer to choose how they wield their power over the general public; some try their best to set a good example, while others exhibit depravity and malevolent behavior. Yao Ming, the famous basketball star, is an excellent example of the type of star who tries at time to look after his fans. If I could meet one famous athlete, I would choose to meet Yao Ming.

Yao Ming is very young to be a member of the esteemed National Basketball Association in North America. In his rookie year he has surpassed all expectations of those knowledgeable with the sport. His skill is attested to by the vast number of people interested in his abilities; in fact his popularity is so great that he has replaced O'Neal as starting center in the American All Star Game, which is no small feat. Yao Ming was also the number one rookie pick last year in the NBA. It would be inspiring to meet someone with such great abilities. He must have worked on his talent from a very young age to achieve such greatness.

Another reason why I would love to meet this great man is because he is an excellent ambassador for China. Yao Ming epitomizes Chinese spirit of hard working to achieve greatness. He in a sense brings China to the world. Although China has become an increasingly important part of international culture, our fair country is still relatively unknown to a large portion of the North American population. Yao Ming has titillated the interest of millions of young people around the world, with the unavoidable effect of bringing a focus to China and Chinese culture.

Finally, why I would like to meet Yao Ming is because he is a genuinely kind person. In spite of his fame and notoriety, in interviews you can see that he has remained a gracious and humble person. As an example of his kindness one must only look at his recent efforts in China to help raise money for SARS research. Therefore, I think that Yao Ming would be an excellent role model for all young people today, both in China and the rest of the world. He is a hard working, dedicated man, with a strong, noble character.

> ### 译文

> **90. 你希望遇到哪位娱乐明星或运动员？**

> 著名的娱乐人士、体育明星有很大的影响力，怎样运用对公众的影响力取决于他们自己。有些人竭力树立一个良好的榜样，而有的人却表现出堕落和道德缺失。其中，著名的篮球明星姚明在照顾自己的球迷方面就树立了很好的榜样。如果能让我见到一个体育名星，我会选择姚明。

> 作为一名北美NBA队员，姚明非常年轻。他刚加入NBA就颠覆了人们对篮球的所有认识。他的技术经过了所有对他的能力感兴趣的人们的考验。事实上，他的名声越来越大，他能取代奥尼尔而成为美国全明星赛的首发中锋，可不是件容易的事。在去年的新手选秀大赛上姚明位列第一。能与如此有能力的人相遇该是件多么令人鼓舞的事情呀。他肯定是从很小的时候就开始努力，并发挥自己的天分，所以才能如此成功。

> 我希望能与姚明相遇的另外一个原因是他是一个优秀的大使。姚明是中国人敬业精神的缩影。从某种意义上来说，姚明把中国带给了世界。虽然中国在世界上的地位日益重要，但是还有很多北美人对我们美丽的国家不是很熟悉。是姚明激起了全世界青少年的兴趣，这也不可避免地使他们也对中国和中国的文化倍感兴趣。

> 最后，我想见到姚明是因为他是一个很善良的人。虽然他名气很大，但是在采访中你可以发现他是一个非常有礼貌，也非常谦虚的人。你只需看一看他在中国为非典研究工作而筹钱的事情，就能知道他的善良。因此，我认为不论对国内还是国外的青少年来说，姚明都是他们学习的榜样。他是一个努力工作、具有奉献精神、有着坚强意志和高贵品格的人。
