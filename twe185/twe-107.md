#107. Should higher education be available to all students or only to good students?

Some people believe that only good students should have access to a university education. Others posit that higher education should be open to everyone, regardless of their academic abilities. I agree with the former opinion. Universities should only allow good students into their programs because these students value the importance of a good education and are interested in furthering their education. Furthermore, if all students were allowed into universities, the schools would quickly become saturated, and the quality of education received would diminish.

A university education is very important to a good student. This type of student has set his/her sights on a university education from early on, and has put in the necessary work to earn a place in a good university. Poor students who did not try to achieve good grades in high school obviously do not care about their education, and therefore, do not deserve to go to university. However, if these poor students go back to school and improve their grades, they should also be allowed to go to university.

Good students are very interested in furthering their education. They have put copious amounts of work into their education, and are interested in learning more. Poor students are usually not as interested in furthering their education. If they were interested in this, they would have tried harder to begin with.

With that said, let us suppose for a moment that universities did allow all students, regardless of their grades, into university. The school would quickly become overfull, and good students, who really care about their education, would suffer because of it. They might not be able to get into the classes they want, and if they do get in, there might be so many students in the class that it is impossible to learn.

In conclusion, I think that it is important to save a university education for those who really want it—good students. If a poor student wishes to go to university, then he/she will have to return to high school and improve his/her grades.

> ### 译文

> **107. 高等教育应该面向全体学生，还是仅面向好学生？**

> 有些人认为只有好学生才有权利接受高等教育。另外有人主张高等教育应该向每个学生敞开大门，不管他或她水平高低。我同意前一种观点。大学教育只应该向好学生敞开大门，因为只有这些学生才重视质量教育的重要性，并有兴趣进一步深造。而且，如果每人都涌入大学，那大学很快就会变得饱和，教育质量也会不断下降。

> 对一个好学生来说，大学教育是非常重要的。这类学生往往很早就已经把目标锁定在上大学，并为进入好大学而不断努力。而那些在高中时学习成绩差的学生显然并不在乎自己的学业，因此，这样的学生不应该上大学。但是，如果这些差学生返回学校，努力学习提高成绩，他们也应该有机会进入高等院校学习。

> 好学生非常乐意继续深造，他们往往接受广泛的教育，并有兴趣学习更多的知识。差学生往往对继续深造没有多少兴趣。如果对此感兴趣的话，他们应该一开始就会多付出一些努力。

> 因此让我们设想一下如果大学不管学生学习成绩的高低，对所有人敞开大门会是什么情景。大学会很快变得人满为患，那些珍惜教育机会的好学生会因此而遭受损失。他们可能无法进入他们想去的教室，既便他们能进入教室，也往往因为人太多而根本没有办法学习。

> 总之，我认为应该把高等教育资源留给那些真正需要它的人——好学生，这点非常重要。如果一个差生希望进入大学，那他或她应该返回中学，努力学习提高成绩。
