#37. Is progress always good?

Progress can be measured in many ways, but one very tangible way to measure progress is by looking at economic development. In these terms, progress can be seen as a very positive force, helping many people rise up from poverty. But history shows that progress, even as measured by economic progress, always has its cost.

Take Germany in the 1930's for example. Humiliated by unequal treaties after World War I, the German people were suffering from a terrible economy and massive inflation. Then Hitler took power and mobilized the German economy, in several years the Germans economy had recovered and was actually becoming among the most powerful in Europe. But Hitler's economic miracle came at a terrible price. His plan was to use Germany's economic power to finance its military power. Germany's aggression sparked World War II, a catastrophe that killed tens of millions of people all over the whole world, including countless millions of civilians. When progress serves evil, the result hurts.

Likewise the progress of America, arguably the most advanced of all nations, has come at a heavy price. America used to be the land of native Americans. America's current"progress" would probably not have been achieved if most of the land in America still belonged to the Native Americans. From their perspective, America's current progress is their profound loss.

Finally, China's economic growth over the past 25 years has been truly remarkable. Standards of living have gone up dramatically, but the progress has negative aspects as well as the obvious positive ones. As income gaps between the rich and the poor widen, social problems like crime and poverty become more pronounced. The damage done to the environment by factories and "progressive" human activity might not be undone for hundreds of years, affecting the lives of Chinese people for generations to come. If these problems are not addressed, our grandchildren might truly come to regret current alleged "progress."

> ### 译文

> **37. 进步总是好事吗？**

> 进步可以从很多方面来衡量，其中衡量进步的一个切实方法就是看经济发展情况。在这方面来看，进步可以看作是一种非常积极的力量，帮助很多人从贫困中摆脱出来。但是历史显示，即使以经济发展来衡量进步也总是有其代价的。

> 以1930年的德国为例。在一战后不平等条约的耻辱中，德国人备受糟糕的经济状况和严重通货膨胀的折磨。然后希特勒掌权并动员发展德国经济，几年内德国的经济就得到了恢复并实际上跻身于欧洲最强的几个国家之列。但是希特勒的经济奇迹代价是骇人的。他的计划是用德国的经济力量来支援其军事力量。德国的侵略引发了二战，这场灾难在全世界范围内杀死了几千万人，其中包括数不清的平民。当进步为邪恶服务时，结果就是伤害。

> 同样地，美国的进步，可以说是所有国家中最巨大的，但也是代价惨重的。美国曾经是美洲土著人的领土。如果大多数美国领土仍然属于美洲土著人，那美国现在的“进步”可能就不会实现。从土著人的立场来看，美国现在的进步是他们重大的损失。
