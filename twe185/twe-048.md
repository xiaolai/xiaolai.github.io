#48. Reasons why people work other than earning a living

One of the most overlooked reasons why people work is to help other people. Government officials, social and charity workers, and religious organizations, and others all work not only for their own salaries, but also work for the common good. They labor for others because of their moral convictions, for reasons of personal reciprocity, and because they want to make society more stable, thereby benefiting themselves and others. Some of the most famous charity workers in the world have been affiliated with religious groups. For instance, many of the foreigners living in the poor regions of Africa are doctors, teachers, and other professionals who are paid by religious organizations to help the poor, sick, and needy people there. These professionals could make much more money if they worked in rich countries. They have chosen to help poor people because they believe their religion tells them to help people who cannot help themselves. They are working for others for moral or religious reasons.

Some people work for other people because at some time in their lives, someone else has helped them. Many teachers can tell stories about a particular teacher who changed their lives. The gift a great teacher gave to them inspired them to become teachers themselves. Likewise, many people become doctors because a doctor saved one of their family member's life and they felt like they owed a debt of gratitude that money could not repay. To such people, the motivation for working is not the paycheck at the end of the month, but the smile on a child's face when they read their first book, or the look of joy on new parents' faces when they see their healthy newborn baby.

Finally, some people work for others because they believe that society is only safe and stable when all of its members are happy. These people include good government officials who try to make policies that benefit the poorer classes of society. They know that only by making policies that help poor people live richer, happier lives can they lower crime, sickness, and poverty rates, and make society safer and happier for all citizens.

> ### 译文

> **48. 除了生存人们工作的其他原因**

> 帮助他人是人们之所以工作的最容易被忽略的理由之一。政府官员、社会与慈善机构工作者、宗教组织以及其他人工作不仅是为了自己的薪水，也是为了公众利益。他们为他人劳作出于道德信仰，个体间的互利互惠，还因为他们想让社会更加稳定，这样才能对自己和他人都有益。

> 世界上一些著名的慈善工作者都从属于慈善团体。例如，许多在非洲贫困地区居住的外国人都是医生、教师和其他专业人员，他们从慈善机构那里领取报酬去帮助贫困、生病与物质匮乏的人。这些专业人员如果在富裕国家里工作挣的钱会多很多。但他们选择了帮助穷人，因为他们相信他们的宗教告诉自己要帮助那些不能自助的人。他们为别人工作是出于道德与宗教的原因。

> 有些人为他人工作是因为他们生活中的某些时候别人也帮助过他们。许多教师会讲述一位让他们的生命发生改变的很特别的老师的故事。好老师赐予他们的礼物促使他们自己也成为教师。同样，很多人成为了医生是因为曾有医生挽救了他们家人的生命，他们觉得欠下了一笔无法用金钱偿还的感激之债。对于这样的人，工作的动机不是月末的薪水支票，而是读到第一本书时孩子脸上的笑容，或者看到刚刚出生的健康宝宝时初为人父母的高兴的表情。

> 最后，一些人为他人工作是因为他们相信只有人人都幸福社会才会安定。这些人中有优秀的政府官员，他们尝试制定政策以使社会的较贫穷阶层受益。他们知道只有通过制定政策帮助穷人过上更加富裕幸福的日子才能减少犯罪、疾病和贫困率，才能使社会对于所有公民来说更加安定幸福。
