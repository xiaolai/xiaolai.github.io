#185. Buy a house or a business?

Choosing whether to buy a house or a business with saved money is a huge decision to make. There are many benefits to both of choices; however, I think that if I had enough money to buy one or the other, I would choose to buy a house.

When one buys a business, he/she is required to spend long, hard hours to ensure that the business is a success. Starting a business is no easy task, and statistics state that half of new businesses fail within the first year. If one buys a house instead of a business, there is nothing that can fail. A house sometimes requires repairs, but usually such repairs can be done on one's own schedule.

A house is also an excellent investment. With the world population rising as quickly as it is, it is a very good idea to become a property owner. In the coming years, land will become more and more expensive, and therefore less attainable. Also, if one buys a house, it is likely that he/she will be able to sell it at a reasonable profit in the future. Providing for one's family is very important, and a house is a stable investment for a family.

Finally, owning a house is a good idea because it saves you from giving someone else money every month for your rent. Usually, when one buys a house, he/she has a mortgage that he/she must pay off in the coming years. In most cases, the mortgage costs approximately the same amount of money as renting an apartment. It makes much more sense to pay for your own home, rather than adding to the wealth of someone else.

In conclusion, I think it is a far better idea to buy a house rather than a business. A house requires less work, it is an excellent investment, and it allows you to keep your money by spending it on your own assets, rather than someone else's. In addition to these reasons, you can also rent out your house to someone else, thus creating an extra source of income for yourself.

> ### 译文

> **185. 买房子，还是买企业？**

> 用积攒的钱来买房子还是买企业是一个重大的决定。做出这两种选择都有不少好处，然而，我认为如果能有足够的钱来购买其中之一，我会选择购买房子。

> 当一个人购买了一个企业，他就得花很多时间来努力工作，以确保企业能够成功。开始经营一个企业并不容易，数据显示一半的新企业都在第一年就倒闭了。如果一个人购买了房子而不是企业，就没有什么可担心的。房子有时可能需要维修，但是这种维修可以按照你自己的时间来进行。

> 房子还是一种很好的投资。随着世界人口如此快速地增长，拥有不动产是非常好的选择。将来，土地会变得越来越贵，并因此越来越难以得到。而且，如果一个人买了房子，那么将来他或她就有可能在利润可观的时候出售房子。支持家庭对于一个人很重要，而房子对于一个家庭来说是一种稳定的投资。

> 最后，拥有房子是个好主意，还因为这样你就不用每月给别人支付房租，从而节约开支。通常，当一个人买了房子，他或她就要每年分期付款偿还抵押借款。在绝大多数情况下，还贷款的金额和租房子的价格差不多。而给自己的家支付金钱比增加别人的财富更加有意义。

> 总之，我认为买房子比买企业要好的多。房子需要更少的工作，是一项极好的投资，而且还能保证你的钱都能花在自己而不是别人的产业上。除了这些原因，你还可以把房子出租给别人，这样你就有增加收入的来源了。
