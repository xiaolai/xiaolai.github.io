#102. Should schools ask students to evaluate their teachers?

Teachers have a very difficult job in society. They not only have to learn how to teach material effectively, but also must learn how to deal with a wide variety of personalities. While teaching is a difficult job, I think it is important for schools to ask students to evaluate their teachers. I think this is the right thing to do because it encourages teachers to try their best, it gives students the opportunity to choose effective teachers, and it allows the schools to have the best teachers possible teaching.

If a teacher knows that at the end of the term, the students will be evaluating his/her work, then the teacher will be driven to do a very good job. If there is no pressure from evaluation, a teacher might be prone to doing a less than perfect job. I believe that everyone needs an occasional evaluation to ensure they are doing their job correctly. In the case of a teacher, the students will give the most important evaluations.

If there was a public summary of which teacher scored the highest on his/ her evaluations, then students would be able to take courses based on which teacher was the best at the job. This would allow students to excel in their studies, and achieve better grades.

Finally, if schools ask students to evaluate their teachers, the schools themselves would be able to have the best teachers working on campus. If a teacher scored too low on an evaluation, a replacement could be found. This is a much better method than waiting for students to complain about a teacher.

Teachers do have a difficult job, but regardless of this, they must excel at it. If a person is a particularly poor teacher, the students will not learn the required material, and suffer for it.

> **102. 学校应该要求学生对教师进行评估吗？**

> 在社会上，教师的工作很难做。不仅要学会如何有效地授课，教师还必须学会如何应对种种个性。尽管教师的工作有其困难性，我仍然认为学校应该让学生来对他们的教师进行评估，这对学校来说很重要。这种做法是正确的，因为这可以激励教师尽全力工作，可以赋予学生选择优秀教师的机会，也可以使学校有可能在教学上拥有最好的教师。

> 如果一位老师知道他或她的学生将在期末时评估他的工作，这会推动他或她把工作做得非常好。如果没有评估的压力，老师有可能表现得稍逊一筹。我认为，每个人都需要时不时地接受评估，以确保他/她在准确地做着工作。对教师而言，学生的评估是最重要的。

> 如果对哪一位教师在评估中获得最高分有一个公开总结，那么学生们就可以根据哪名教师教得最好来选择课程。这有利于学生学习优秀，取得更好的成绩。

> 我想说的最后一点是：如果学校让学生评估老师，学校本身就能够招揽最好的教师来工作。如果某位老师在评估中取得的分数太低，就该考虑找代替者了。与其等待学生来抱怨哪位老师不好，采用这种评估的做法会好得多。

> 老师的工作的确难做，尽管如此，他们必须做得出色。如果老师不好，学生们就学不到所需知识，并为此而付出代价。
