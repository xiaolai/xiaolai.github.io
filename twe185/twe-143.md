#143. Should students be given a long vacation or several short vacations?

Vacation is a very important part of student life. I would agree that it is best for the students to have many short vacations.

School can be a very tiring, tedious experience at times. If students get regular breaks in between intensive periods of studies, they will be more relaxed and ready to learn new material upon returning to school. In addition to this, a change in environment, even if only for a week, gives one the opportunity to relax while reflecting on one's studies. Many students find that even a short break allows them to refresh enough to continue with school.

Having many breaks throughout the year is also good for one's social life. If people have the opportunity to catch up with friends and family on a regular basis throughout the year, they will never feel as though they were losing touch with loved ones. Socializing with friends and family is also an excellent way to relax. If students frequently have this kind of opportunity, they will be more at ease and ready for the next semester of school.

Moreover, if the school year is broken down into many short semesters, the schools will be able to put a greater amount of focus into the curriculum of the courses. Many students find that by the end of a long semester, they have forgotten the information that they learned at the beginning of the term. By having short, intensive study sessions, students will quickly learn a small amount of information, and thus be able to keep it locked in their minds for a long time to come.

Consequently, I think that it is vastly preferable to have numerous short vacations throughout the year. Students will find that they are more relaxed, and can better focus on their studies all year round.

> ### 译文

> **143. 应该给学生一个长假还是几个短假？**

> 上学有时候可以是一种非常令人疲惫、枯燥乏味的经历。如果一个学生在集中的学习时段之间获得定期的休息，他将会更加放松，更加愿意在回到学校时学习新的内容。除此以外，环境的改变，哪怕只有一个星期，也会给一个人提供在学习之余的放松机会。许多学生发现，即便是一个短暂的休息也让他们足以恢复精神继续学习。

> 全年中有许多休息还有助于一个人的社交生活。如果人们在一年中有机会定期和朋友和家人团聚的话，那将永远不会感觉自己好象在失去与至亲好友们的接触。与朋友和家人来往也是很好的放松手段。如果学生经常有这种机会，他们将更加放松，更好地为下个学期的学习做好准备。

> 而且，如果学年被分成许多个短的学期，学校就能够把更多的注意力分散在各个科目的课程里面。许多学生发现，在一个很长的学期结束之际，他们已经忘记了自己在学期初所学到的东西。有了短暂集中的学期，学生们将会迅速地学习少量的知识，因而能够在将来很长一段时间内将其牢记在脑海中。

> 所以，我认为在全年中设置许多短暂的假期是非常可取的。学生们将发现，他们更加放松，而且全年都能够更好地集中精力在学习上。
