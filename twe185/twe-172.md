#172. How can schools help new students with their problems?

Moving to a new school is often a traumatizing experience. The student must go through the sometimes arduous process of making new friends, while attempting to keep up with school and keep in touch with old friends. There are many ways in which the school could help ease this process.

In order to make new students feel less anxious about their new surroundings, it would be beneficial for the school to start a welcoming committee. Such a committee would include students from all age levels, who are particularly friendly. The committee would organize small events during lunch hours and after school to help the new student feel at home. For example, the committee could organize a lunch followed by a tour of the playground. This would allow the new student to make new friends.

Schools should also train teachers on how to properly deal with new students. The first thing the teachers should do is to attempt to seat the new student around others who will be a good influence on him/her. This is of utmost importance, as a young student must be encouraged to socialize with smart, friendly students who have a strong work ethic.

Furthermore, a teacher must ensure that the student has a firm grasp of all the topics being taught. It is possible that the student's previous school taught different subject matter, or worked at a slower pace. The student might need extra help to catch up with the rest of the students. Conversely, a new student might be more advanced than the other students at his/her new school. If this is the case, the teacher must organize activities for the student so he/she does not become disinterested in learning.

In sum, schools can greatly facilitate a student's arrival to their premises. By enlisting the help of the students and properly instructing the teachers on how to deal with such situations, the student will feel welcome and at home in his new environment.

> **172. 学校如何帮助新生面对困难？**

> 换到一所新的学校经常会是一种精神受到创伤的经历。有时候学生必须经历艰辛的结交新朋友的过程，同时还要努力赶上学校的课程并且和老朋友保持联系。学校可以采取很多方式来帮助学生减轻这个过程中的痛苦。

> 为了让新来的学生对新的环境感到不那么紧张，学校应该成立一个欢迎委员会。这样一个委员会应该包括各个年龄阶段的待人特别友好的学生。委员会可以在午餐时间或者放学之后组织一些小型的活动，来帮助新来的学生感觉自在。比如，委员会可以组织一次午餐，随后去参观操场。这样就能让新来的学生们结交新的朋友。

> 学校也应该就如何妥善安排新来的学生对教师们进行培训。教师们首先应该尽量把新学生的座位安排在那些可能对他或她产生良好影响的同学旁边。这是非常重要的，因为必须鼓励一个新来的学生和聪明、友好而且有很好道德规范的那些学生打成一片。

> 此外，教师还应该确保新来的学生能够很好地掌握正在教授的全部内容。新学生以前的学校里很可能会教授不同的科目内容，或者学习的进度比较慢。他们会需要额外的帮助以便能够赶上其他学生。相反，新学生也可能比新学校里的同学们水平更高。如果是这样，教师必须给新学生组织活动，防止他产生厌学情绪。

> 总而言之，学校能够极大地帮助学生达到他们的目标。通过学生的帮助以及合理指导教师如何处理这种情况，学校能让新学生在新的环境中觉得受欢迎和舒适。
