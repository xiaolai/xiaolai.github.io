#111. Spend time with one or two close friends, or with a large number of friends?

Of the two possibilities, I prefer the first, that is, to spend my time with one or two close friends, because I enjoy close friendship with one or two people and the cozy atmosphere of spending time with close friends.

When spending time with a large number of friends, it tends to be difficult to form solid, meaningful friendships with any of the people, since cultivating friendship needs time to communicate. On the other hand, when spending time with only one or two close friends, it is more likely to get to know these people on a very close level. I think this closeness is very important in a friendship. In fact, if I share no closeness with a person, then I do not consider him a friend; I consider him an acquaintance.

Moreover, it is not only closeness but also the cozy atmosphere that makes me prefer spending time with only one or two friends. In this cozy atmosphere, I always feel there is nothing that I could not or would not tell my friends, as they feel the same. This means we can trust each other completely. Although this doesn't at all mean there's no cozy atmosphere or complete trust when spending time with many friends, it is my observation that everyone tends to be more open in private. This is why I enjoy the intimate friendship.

In addition, spending time with few friends can save much time, since the relationship among a few people is more likely to be simpler. I'm not proficient at dealing with relationship among people, and often get frustrated communicating with a crowd. However, when I am spending time with one or two close friends, this doesn't matter at all. In fact, my close friends, notwithstanding few in number, always tell me I'm their best friend who can truly care about them and handle the relationship smoothly. I think it is my personality that has made me such a choice.

> ### 译文

> **111. 与一两个亲密朋友在一起，还是与许多朋友在一起？**

> 以上两者，我偏爱前者，也就是说，我更爱和一两个亲密朋友在一起。因为我更看重与一两个人建立的亲密友谊，更沉醉于和一两知己在一起时的那份温馨。

> 当和一大帮朋友在一起时，很难同其中的任何一位建立牢固而深挚的友谊，因为情谊的培养需要时间的投入。另一方面，当仅和一两亲密友人在一起，更易深入了解他们。这对友谊至关重要。事实上，那些和我不够亲密的人，我不把他们当作朋友，而是视为熟人。

> 另外，不仅是那份亲密使我更喜与一两朋友在一起，更是因为那种温馨。在温馨的氛围里，我和朋友互吐衷心，无所不言。我们彼此全然信任。虽然这并不意味着和一大帮朋友在一起时失之亲密、疏于温馨，但据我观察，在私下里人更易吐露心声。这就是为何我更看重深切的友谊。

> 再者，因为两三个人之间的人际关系更简单，所以与一两知己在一起更省时间。我并不擅长处理人际关系，常惴栗于大庭广众。而与一两知己在一起时就不会这样。事实上，我的知己虽少，但他们总是告诉我我是他们最好的朋友、我真心关心他们、我和他们关系融洽。我想大抵是我的性格使我做出这一选择吧。
