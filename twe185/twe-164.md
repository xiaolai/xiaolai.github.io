#164. What do you do for good health?

Scientists have discovered that one of the main methods of prolonging a person's life is to keep healthy. There are many different methods to keep in good shape, and one must choose those that are most appropriate for their own lifestyle. Personally, in order to keep healthy, I eat well, exercise, and get lots of rest.

Eating well is an excellent way to keep healthy. If one is constantly drinking pop or eating fried foods, they will not be able to keep a healthy weight. One must eat lots of vegetables and fruit, and stay away from all foods that are high in cholesterol. In order to maintain a low level of cholesterol in my diet, I tend to eat more fish rather than heavier meats. Fish is much healthier than red meat, and I find it much tastier as well.

Exercising is also very important to leading a healthy lifestyle. One should exercise for at least half an hour, three to four times a week. Exercise can include anything from going to the gym to "work out", to going on a long walk around the city. If I am particularly busy, I will walk up the stairs to my apartment rather than taking the elevator. This provides me with the minimum amount of exercise necessary to stay fit.

The third thing I do to keep healthy is sleep well and often. I typically sleep for approximately eight and a half hours every night. Sleep is very important, as your body uses this rest time to heal itself. If one tries to live for long periods of time without sleep, they will quickly become haggard and disheveled. Sleep is absolutely necessary for a healthy life.

In conclusion, I find that eating well, exercising and sleeping often is the best way for me to keep healthy. If a person can change their lifestyle and incorporate these three ideas, they will be much better off for it. A person who leads a healthy lifestyle will be less likely to get sick, and they will live longer.

> **164. 为了健康，你做些什么？**

> 科学家已经发现延长一个人生命的主要方式之一就是保持健康。保持健康的方法很多，一个人必须选择最适合自己生活方式的那些方法。就我个人而言，为了保持健康，我注意饮食、运动并且保持充足的睡眠。

> 注意饮食是保持健康的一个绝佳方法。如果一个人不停地喝汽水或者吃油炸食品，就很难保持健康的体重。一个人必须吃大量的蔬菜和水果，并且远离各种胆固醇含量高的食品。为了把我饮食中的胆固醇含量保持在较低的水平，我倾向于更多地吃鱼，而不是油腻的肉类。鱼类比肉类更为健康，而且我发现鱼的口感也更好。

> 运动对于健康的生活方式也非常重要。一个人每周应该运动三到四次，每次至少半个小时。运动可以包括任何方式，可以去健身房里“锻炼”，也可以在城市里长时间散步。如果我非常忙碌，回家的时候我会走楼梯而不是坐电梯。这样会给我提供保持健康所需要的最低运动量。

> 为了保持健康，我做的第三件事就是保持良好的睡眠。我通常每个晚上睡大约八个半小时。睡眠非常重要，因为你的身体会使用这段时间进行自我修复。如果一个人长时间不睡觉的话，很快就会变得憔悴而不整洁。睡眠对于健康的生活是绝对必须的。

> 总之，我认为注意饮食、运动并且保持充足的睡眠对我来说是保持健康的最佳方式。如果人们能够改变自己的生活方式，并且结合使用这三种方法，他们的状态会更好。一个有着健康生活方式的人不会那么容易生病，而且寿命会更长。
