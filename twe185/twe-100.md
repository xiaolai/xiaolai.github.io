#100. Spend money on developing or buying computer technology, or on more basic needs?

I believe that governments spend too much money on new computer technologies, when they should be focusing on the needs or people in their countries. There are a number of reasons why I think this would be a better usage of a country's money.

Throughout the world, there are millions and millions of people who are homeless, and cannot afford to eat. These people need help from the government. If the government has so much money to spend on computer technology, they should easily be able to have enough money to help these people gain entry to the working world. The government could set up programs which allow homeless people to train for jobs. This would be a much better way to spend money than building computers.

Pollution is another major problem which plagues all of the industrial nations. Instead of spending money frivolously, we should be focusing on how to fix the one we live on. The ozone layer is getting thinner and thinner every year, which means that the sun's radiation is causing more damage to people and the environment. The governments need to design a method to drastically reduce pollution.

In addition to the problems of pollution and homelessness, the general population could use the money as well. In many countries, including our own, the health care and education systems leave something to be desired. I think that more money should be put towards making citizens healthier and wiser.

With that said, many of the above disagreements need the help of the computer industry. Computers can help governments to keep track of all of the people they need to take care of, and programs can be designed which help isolate problems with the environment. Computers are important, as long as a government does not forget to take care of its people.

> **100.把钱用在发展或购买计算机技术上，还是用在基本需求上？**

> 我认为，政府把太多的钱用在了计算机新技术方面，而他们应该关注的是满足国民的需求。之所以持这种观点，原因如下：

> 全世界还有数以万记的人无家可归，无以果腹。这些人需要政府的帮助。如果政府有那么多钱用在研发计算机技术上，那么就应该很容易有足够的钱来帮助这些人找到工作。政府应该拟订计划来帮助这些无家可归的人进行职业培训。相比研究计算机而言，这是一种更好的花钱方式。

> 污染是折磨着所有工业化国家的另一个主要问题。我们应该关注如何“修理”这个我们赖以生存的星球，而不是盲目地花钱。年复一年，臭氧层正在日益稀薄，这意味着太阳的辐射正在给人类和环境带来更严重的危害。政府需要设计方案来大幅度减轻污染。

> 除了那些污染问题和无家可归的人，我们普通人也需要用钱。在许多国家，包括我们自己的国家，卫生保健和教育体系遗留下大量问题亟待解决。在我看来，应该用更多的钱来使公民更加健康、接受更多的教育。

> 诚然，上述争论需要计算机技术来帮助解决。计算机可以帮助政府记录下所有需要照顾的人的名单，可以设计程序使污染问题与人类隔离。只要政府没有忘记照顾好国民，计算机同样也是重要的。
