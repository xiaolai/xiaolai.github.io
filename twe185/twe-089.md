#89. What famous person from history would you like to meet?

Throughout history, there have been thousands and thousands of inventors, prophets and visionaries who have dramatically affected the way we live today. If I could meet one of these people, I would choose to meet Tomas Edison, one of the greatest inventors that I respect.

This great man invented thousands of useful products that we still use today, the most famous of which is the electric light bulb. In addition to the light bulb, Edison created the phonograph, the storage batteries, telegraph systems, and a wide variety of other products. To have invented such a diverse range of items, Tomas must have been a brilliant man. I would greatly enjoy meeting him and discussing some of his ideas with him. I am sure that such a meeting would be a great inspiration, and perhaps lead me to create new inventions of my own.

One of Tomas Edison's projects was a working version of the electric car. If he had continued to work on this invention instead of moving on to something new, and if the project was successful, perhaps the world would not have the pollution problems that are so widely present today. It is unfortunate that he did not focus more on this invention. If I could meet him, perhaps I could convince him, that for the sake of future generations, he should not give up on his idea.

Furthermore, what makes me believe that Tomas Edison would be an excellent person to meet from history is because I would love to find out what the keys to his inspirations were. He had so many brilliant ideas; there must have been a secret to his success that I'm dying to know. Perhaps it was just that he was such a hardworking man. He was constantly working on inventions until his late 60's, when finally, he took a rest from inventions. Tomas Edison had a profound effect on all modern societies around the world. His inventions were a catalyst to modernization; in fact, the world would not be where it is today if it were not for this great man and his great mind.

> ### 译文

> **89. 你希望遇到历史上的哪位名人？**

> 旷古至今，历史上有无数的发明家、先知、空想家等在很大程度上影响了我们的生活。如果我能够遇到他们其中的一位的话，我将会选择托马斯·爱迪生，因为他是我所尊敬的最伟大的发明家之一。

> 这位伟人发明了上千种我们至今仍然在使用的东西，其中最有名的就是电灯泡的发明。除了电灯泡，他还发明了留声机、蓄电池、电报，以及其他很多东西。爱迪生发明了这么多东西，那么他肯定是一位很杰出的人，因此，遇见他我将会很高兴，而且要同他讨论一些他的思想。我相信，对我来说这样的一次会面将可以激发我很大的灵感，说不定我也能够发明些新东西。

> 爱迪生的一个项目就是电车的工作模型。如果他一直致力于该产品的研究而不是转向了其他产品，并且如果这个产品成功了，也许世界上就不会有今天这样严重的污染问题了。但不幸的是，他没有继续研究电车。如果我能够见到他，可能我会说服他为了子孙后代而继续他在此方面的研究。

> 此外，我之所以认为爱迪生是我愿意遇到的历史上的杰出人物，是因为我想知道他灵感从何而来。他有那么多好主意，他一定有不为人所知的走向成功的秘密。这是我非常想知道的。秘密也许就在于他工作非常认真努力。他一直致力于新东西的发明创造，直到60多岁才停止。爱迪生对现代社会产生了深远的影响，他的发明是现代化的催化剂。实际上，如果没有爱迪生和他那伟大的思想，世界就不可能是今天这个样子。
