#157. Studying at home by using technology or at traditional schools?

The technology industry is growing at a faster rate as each year passes by. With a relatively inexpensive computer and a web camera, it is now possible for one to have a videoconference with one's friends and colleagues. Students will soon be presented with the opportunity to study from home. However, I believe that attending a traditional school is greatly preferable to learning in a virtual classroom. Traditional schools allow the student to socialize, they give the student direct access to the teacher, and they prepare the student for the environment of the working world.

Many people say that they met their best friends while attending high school. These friendships were solidified over spending hours and hours in the same classrooms together, and working together on group projects. While it is conceivable that students studying from home would meet each other over the Internet, the bonds that are formed in classrooms cannot be replaced.

Forming personal relationships with one's teachers is also an excellent idea that would be difficult to realize if one did not attend classes. Most of our relationships with our teachers are formed by interaction both in the classroom, and outside it. For example, if a student was constantly at school, either working in the library, or perhaps eating lunch in the cafeteria, it is more than possible that he/she would converse with his/her teachers on many occasions. Developing a relationship with one's teacher is important as it helps one to build his/her business network.

Traditional schools also have the advantage of training students for "the real world." If a student never has to work with others on a project, or report to his/her teachers, he/she will not have a very good grasp as to what it means to work in a team environment or respect authority. The way that school operates forces students to develop these important skills.

In conclusion, I think it would be much more beneficial for all students to attend traditional schools rather than study at home. Attending a school helps students to develop the necessary social skills needed to survive in today's fast

pace world.

> ### 译文

> **157. 在家通过高科技学习还是去学校学习？**

> 每一年科技工业都在以更快的速度发展，用一台相对而言并不昂贵的电脑和一个网络摄像机，现在人们已经有可能和朋友以及同事们召开视频会议。学生们也很快就能有机会在家里上学了。然而，我认为去传统学校上学远比在一间虚拟教室里学习更为可取。传统学校能使学生社会化，在那里学生能直接和老师接触，而这些都是在为将来的工作环境做准备。

> 很多人都说在上高中时交到了他们最好的朋友。这种友谊随着一起在同一间教室里度过一个又一个小时、共同完成小组项目而逐渐深厚。虽然我们可以想象在家学习的学生们可以通过互联网见到彼此，但是在教室里建立起来的亲密的人际关系是无法替代的。

> 和自己的老师建立起私人关系是个很好的想法，但是如果不去上学这就很难实现。我们和老师们的关系绝大部分是通过在教室内外的各种相互影响而形成的。例如，如果学生一直呆在学校里，无论是在图书馆里学习，还是在自助餐厅里吃午餐，都可能会有很多机会和老师交谈。和自己的老师建立关系是很重要的，因为这有助于他或她将来建立自己的商业网络。

> 传统学校还有训练学生适应“真实世界”的优势。如果学生从来都不需要和他人一起为一个项目工作，或者向老师们报告情况，他或她就不能很好地了解如何在团队中工作以及尊重权威人士的意义。学校的运行方式强迫学生们发展这些重要的技巧。
