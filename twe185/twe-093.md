#93. What makes a good roommate?

While studying at university, many students find that sharing an apartment with roommates is the best living situation available. These arrangements can work out quite well, as long as one chooses the right roommate. There are a number of important qualities that one should look for in a potential roommate. These qualities include friendliness, cleanliness, and a good work ethic.

Choosing a friendly roommate is very important if one wants to create a healthy living environment. If one's roommate is unfriendly, many annoying situations can occur. For example, if one's roommate is unfriendly, it is difficult to hold a conversation with him/her. Being able to have a pleasant conversation is vital, as everyone needs to have a short break from studying from time to time. Conversations can help us to relax a little bit, and can even be a stimulus to continue our work.

Having a clean roommate is also very important. If one's roommate is messy, it can lead to many arguments over whose turn it is to do the cleaning. If one constantly has to clean up after his/her roommate, he/she will have less time to concentrate on his/her studies. Also, living in a clean environment allows one to be much more successful in all endeavors.

Finally, a roommate should have a good work ethic. If one's roommate is constantly procrastinating and waiting until the last minute to do assignments, it can ruin one's ability to do his/her own work. If a roommate is always coming home late or playing music loudly instead of doing work, it will be very difficult for a studious person to get anything done.

In conclusion, I believe that having a clean friendly roommate with a good work ethic is most enjoyable. It allows one to get on with his/her own work, and to concentrate on what matters most: getting good grades.

> ### 译文

> **93.好室友需具备的重要品质是什么？**

> 读大学的时候，很多学生会发现与室友同住一套公寓是切实可行的最佳居住环境。只要选择对了合适的室友，这种分配方式会带来很好的效果。在找寻室友时，应该注意对方是否具有这样一些重要品质：待人友好，讲究卫生和有良好的学习习惯。

> 如果想创造一个良好的生活环境，选择友善的室友非常重要。如果室友不友好，会发生许多令人苦恼的事情。比如说，如果室友不友好，就很难与其交谈。能够进行愉快的谈话是非常重要的事情，毕竟每个人都需要不时地从学习中解脱出来稍事休息。交谈会帮助我们放松一下，甚至会激励我们继续投入学习。

> 有一个爱干净的室友也非常重要。如果室友很邋遢，就会在谁该值日打扫卫生这一问题上产生很多争论。如果一个人不得不不停地跟在室友后面打扫卫生，收拾室友留下来的烂摊子，他或她的学习时间必然就会减少。而且，居住在干净的环境里也会让一个人全力以赴，取得更大的成功。

> 一个好的室友所应具备的最后一个品质是应该有良好的学习习惯。如果室友总是拖延到最后一刻才开始做功课，这也会破坏别人完成功课的积极性。如果室友总是晚归或者大声地播放音乐而不是做作业，再勤奋的人也会受其影响，难以做任何事情。

> 总而言之，我认为有一个友善的、爱干净并有良好学习习惯的室友最令人高兴。这样会让人专心于自己的学业，把精力集中于最重要的事情：取得好的学习成绩。
